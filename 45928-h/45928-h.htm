      CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTORY. EXPLANATIONS AND PLEDGES.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE "History of the
      Great Rebellion," as some have called it, or of "The American Conflict,"
      as others have called it, has been written over and over&mdash;by Greeley,
      by McClusky, by Abbott, by Kattell, by Pollard, and by others&mdash;and it
      is not my intention to write it again: but I Purpose, as Macaulay says in
      the first two words of that wonderful History of England in which, by the
      magic of his pen, he has made facts, which, until then, had lain only in
      the brains of old women, in the traditions of old men, in forgotten
      newspapers, and in neglected pamphlets, come forth in all the habiliments
      of life; some grinning with merriment, and others frowning with despair&mdash;some
      as angels of heaven, and others as demons of hell&mdash;I Purpose,
      throughout the whole of this volume, to write of the sayings and doings of
      those who, in the great war between the United States and the "Southern
      Confederacy," stood in the side wings, or <i>behind</i> the scenes, as
      proprietors, as stockholders, as lessees, as stage managers, as prompters,
      as scene-shifters, as curtain-droppers, as wire-pullers, and without whom
      the acts <i>before</i> the scenes could not have been, and would not have
      been, enacted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many, yea, most of those who attended to their various parts behind the
      scenes, while those in front were attending to theirs, have gone to their
      long homes. Like the hero of a hundred battles&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "They sleep their last sleep and have fought their last battle,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      No sound can awake them to glory again;"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      yet a few remain, scattered throughout the North, scattered throughout the
      South, in cities, in towns, in offices, in workshops, in negro huts; and
      from these, and such as these, we have gathered and now propose to put on
      record, the <i>inner</i> or <i>secret</i> history of the greatest war of
      the nineteenth century&mdash;a war in which more men were engaged, more
      deeds of valor done, more lives lost, and during which there was more of
      masterly diplomacy exercised, on both sides, than in any war which has
      occurred since the days of the Roman empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eighteen years ago! Only three words, uttered in a single breath and
      seeming but as yesterday, when looking backward, and yet where is the
      tongue that can tell, or the pen that can write all that has transpired
      within that time?
    </p>
    <p>
      Fields made desolate by battles then are now waving with grain, covered by
      green swards, or bedecked with flowers; what were then hastily constructed
      earthworks are now grassy mounds; covered over with shrubbery; what then
      were rifle-pits are now pleasant pathways for man and beast; cities then
      burned, or otherwise made desolate through the ravages of war, have
      regained more than their former size, beauty, and commercial prosperity;
      plantations then laid waste have been restored to more than their former
      productiveness; wounds, ghastly, bloody wounds, then made by shot or
      shell, or sabre cut, are now so healed that even the cicatrices are
      scarcely observable; and, but for vacant chairs in many households, and
      too well-filled cemeteries at Arlington Heights, at Gettysburg, and all
      over the land, it would be difficult for us now to realize that a
      terrible, desolating war had swept over this country within so short a
      time as eighteen years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time is indeed the great leveller, bringing king and subject, master and
      slave, to a common platform; nor is it less the great assuager and healer.
      Passions which burned in the breasts of men with the fierceness of a
      furnace, eighteen years ago, have so smouldered and died out, that not
      even a spark can now be found on the hearthstones of their hearts; and
      hence it is that what could not have been told fifteen, ten, or even five
      years ago, without the risk of inflaming passions and leading to greater
      harm than good, may now be told without the slightest objection either
      from actors or subjects. In history, as in law, there are <i>statutes of
      limitation</i>, and when these bounds are once passed, all that occurred
      previous to those dates is wiped from the record of <i>personal</i>
      responsibility, and becomes the property of the historian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most, if not all, of the facts which I purpose to incorporate in this
      history will be new&mdash;that is, such as have never been published
      before. They have been known, of course, to the actors and to a few
      confidential friends, and vague hints of their existence have found their
      way in newspapers from time to time; but never before have they reached
      the public eye or ear in book form; nor would they now, but for the fact
      that the limitation of responsibility has so far passed, that no possible
      harm can come from their publicity. To make the new facts intelligible as
      to time and bearing, old facts will, in some cases, have to be repeated,
      but in all such cases the old facts will be but the frames, while the new
      facts will be the pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though we are not at liberty in all cases to give the sources of our
      information, yet no one need question the substantial correctness of every
      statement found in this volume, though it may occasionally happen that
      names have been given incorrectly or misspelled, or that the dates are not
      precise. To remember names and dates is not easy for any one, and that,
      after a lapse of fifteen years, some of these should have been partially
      or entirely forgotten by some of our informants, is not at all strange. Of
      course we can only give the statements as received. Most of them we have
      had direct from the lips of those who were participants in the scenes,
      others from official sources, that is, from those who were in, or directly
      connected with, governmental departments; others, from hints given at the
      time, but the details of which could not be stated until the prejudices
      and passions of the war had subsided; and still others, from those who had
      them from the lips of the participants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the facts and incidents hereafter to be related are but new
      manifestations of the Fabian policy, and however unfair they would have
      seemed to Northern people had they been known at the time, yet now, few,
      if any, will regard them other than as acts of masterly diplomacy upon the
      part of Mr. Davis and his cabinet. But for this policy, the Southern
      Confederacy would have had to succumb at least two years before it did;
      and, on the principle that "while there is life there is hope," the longer
      they could prolong the contest the more to their credit. The relative
      strength of the North and South, at the beginning of the war, may be
      fairly represented by the numbers 20 and 10. Now take one off from each at
      five successive engagements, and the figures will stand 15 and 5. Before,
      the smaller equalled the one-half of the larger number, now it equals only
      the one-third. Again take one off from each at four more engagements, and
      the figures will stand 11 and 1&mdash;the smaller representing only the
      one-eleventh part of the larger, while one more engagement wipes out the
      smaller number entirely, and yet leaves the one-half of the larger. From
      this plain mathematical statement it will be seen how important it was for
      the Southern Confederacy to pursue the Fabian policy of delay, both as to
      its operations in the field, and in its diplomacy with English and
      Northern capitalists.
    </p>
    <p>
      The learning of these "<i>Secrets of the Late Rebellion</i>" has had the
      effect to increase, rather than lessen, our admiration of Jefferson Davis
      as a statesman, and such we think will be the effect upon all who may read
      this book. However much we may condemn his political principles, however
      much we may condemn the rebellion, and however rejoiced we may be that he
      and it failed of success, yet, now that we know of the secret as well as
      the open difficulties with which he had to contend, we cannot but admire
      the talent, the energy, and the perseverance with which he overcame them
      all for months and years; and at last only yielded to necessities which no
      foresight, no talent, no energy could have overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor is he the only one of the "Lost Cause" whom these "Secrets" make us to
      admire the more. Others, many others, as will be seen by the following
      chapters, acted their parts nobly and well, and deserve more credit than
      has ever yet been accorded to them by the historian; while others whose
      secret fiendish acts are herein recorded, acted worse, a thousandfold
      worse, than the public ever knew or probably would have known but for the
      appearance of this volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      In putting on record the following facts and incidents of the war, my aim
      shall be to view everything from a historic standpoint only. As a Northern
      man, and as a late officer in the army, my partisanship and prejudices
      during the war were doubtless as strong as those of any other man; but so
      far as I know my own heart, not a particle of that partisanship or
      prejudice now remains, and I believe that I can write of both sides with
      equal impartiality. In relating the incidents, I may not have occasion to
      express any opinion at all for or against; but if I should, my readers may
      rest assured that it will be done without a particle of prejudice. With
      these explanations, and these pledges, I am now ready to begin the
      relation of facts and incidents as they occurred <i>Behind the Scenes</i>
      during the late War. J. R. F.

      CHAPTER II. RUNNING THE LAND BLOCKADE. KING COTTON BEHIND THE SCENES.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>N the 4th of
      February, 1861, the Confederate Congress met at Montgomery, Ala. It was
      composed of nine delegates from Alabama, three from Florida, ten from
      Georgia, six from Louisiana, seven from Mississippi, three from North
      Carolina, seven from South Carolina&mdash;forty-five in all.
    </p>
    <p>
      They adopted the old Constitution of the United States, with the exception
      of five clauses. The first was a change in the preamble&mdash;making the
      States named, other than "We the people," the contracting parties; the
      second change related to the "importation of African negroes," etc.; the
      third related to the escape and delivery of slaves; the fourth related to
      adjusting disputes between the contracting States; the fifth empowered
      Congress to "lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, etc." The
      Constitution, as amended, was adopted February 8th, and on the same day
      Jefferson Davis, of Mississippi, was elected President, and Alexander H.
      Stephens, of Georgia, Vice-President, by a unanimous vote.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 18th of February Mr. Davis was inaugurated, and immediately after
      he nominated, and Congress confirmed, the following cabinet:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Secretary of State...............................Robert Toombs.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Secretary of the Treasury....................C. G. Memminger.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Secretary of War................................L. Pope Walker.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      This same Congress authorized a loan of fifteen million dollars, secured
      by an export duty on cotton, and passed an act "To modify the navigation
      laws, and to repeal all discriminating duties on ships and vessels"&mdash;by
      which the entire coasting trade from Charleston to Galveston was thrown
      open to the British flag. Had English capitalists framed the law, they
      could not have made it to please themselves better.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 17th of April, 1861, President Davis issued a proclamation offering
      to grant letters of marque and reprisal to aid the Southern Confederacy in
      resisting what he called "the wanton and wicked aggressions" of the United
      States government.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this President Lincoln immediately responded by issuing a proclamation,
      dated April 19th, declaring the Southern ports in a state of blockade.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Congress of the Southern Confederacy assembled at Montgomery again on
      the 29th of April, 1861. President Davis, in his message, advised the
      immediate passage of a law authorizing the acceptance of proposals for
      privateers. He denounced the proclamation of President Lincoln in relation
      to Southern ports as a mere paper blockade. "The loan authorized," he
      said, "had been promptly taken (by whom, or on what terms, he did not
      say); and that a much larger amount had now become necessary to defray the
      expenses of the war," etc., etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Congress authorized President Davis to issue letters of marque and
      reprisal, and prescribed regulations for the conduct of privateers. It
      also passed an act prohibiting the export of cotton or cotton yam from any
      of the Confederate States, except through their own seaports, under a
      penalty of forfeiture of the cotton, a fine of five thousand dollars, and
      six months' imprisonment. It further proposed that the planters should be
      invited to put their crops into the hands of the government, and accept
      Confederate bonds for their value. On the 20th of May, 1861, this Congress
      adjourned, to reassemble at Richmond, Va., in two months.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 20th of July, 1861, the Confederate Congress reassembled at
      Richmond. Meanwhile the cabinet had been enlarged as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Secretary of the Navy...........S. R. Mallory, of Florida.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Postmaster-General...............J. H. Reagan, of Texas.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Attorney-General.................J. P. Benjamin, of Louisiana.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      This Congress included sixty-eight members, of whom fifteen were from
      Virginia, ten from North Carolina, nine from Alabama, three from Florida,
      ten from Georgia, six from Louisiana, seven from Mississippi, eight from
      South Carolina.
    </p>
    <p>
      President Davis stated in his message that "fifty million dollars had been
      subscribed in cotton," and that "late crops had been abundant." Among the
      first acts of this reassembled Congress was to adopt the convention of
      Paris in 1856, in respect to maritime law, whereby the wishes of Great
      Britain were acceded to in all respects. This was, in effect, that
      enemies' goods should be respected in neutral ships, and that privateering
      should be abolished in time of war. The United States government had
      demurred to these propositions, for reasons ably stated at the time by
      Secretary Marcy, and afterwards reaffirmed by Secretary Seward. Had they
      become a part of national law, Great Britain could have taken every bale
      of cotton from the ports of the Southern Confederacy without let or
      hindrance. So far as the Confederacy was concerned, this act of their
      Congress gave full consent; but the United States still objected, nor had
      the propositions been concurred in by all other nations. This same
      Congress empowered President Davis to appoint two commissioners, with full
      powers, to proceed to Great Britain and other European countries, to
      negotiate a recognition of the Southern Confederacy, and, if practicable,
      make treaties of commerce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus briefly stated the organization, the acts, and the position of
      the Southern Confederacy with regard to financial and cotton questions&mdash;the
      only questions now under consideration&mdash;we will next trace the acts
      of the United States government bearing upon the same questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Confederate Congress first met at Montgomery, Mr. Buchanan still
      occupied the Presidential chair at Washington; but he had done nothing to
      interfere with the organization of the Southern Confederacy, nor, in his
      view of the case, had he any power or authority to interfere. One month
      after, on the 4th of March, 1861, Abraham Lincoln, of Illinois, was
      inaugurated President, Hannibal Hamlin, of Maine, Vice-President, and
      immediately after the cabinet of Mr. Lincoln was formed as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Secretary of State....................Wm. H. Seward, of New York.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Secretary of the Treasury.........S. P. Chase, of Ohio.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Secretary of War.....................Simon Cameron, of Penna.

    <p class="indent15">
      Secretary of the Navy..............Gideon Wells, of Conn.

    <p class="indent15">
      Postmaster-General.................Montgomery Blair, of Md.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Attorney-General.....................Edward Bates, of Mo.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      After the inauguration of President Lincoln, the United States Senate
      remained in session until the 28th of March, occupied most of the time
      with confirmations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after the attack upon Fort Sumter, April 14th, 1861, President
      Lincoln issued a call for 75,000 troops; called an extra session of
      Congress to meet on the 4th of July following, and on the 19th of April,
      as heretofore stated, issued a proclamation declaring all the Southern
      ports in a state of blockade. The blockading squadron on the Atlantic
      coast, on the 4th of July, 1861, consisted of twenty-two vessels, with 290
      guns and 3300 men, under command of flag-officer Stringham. The Gulf
      squadron, at the same time, consisted of twenty-one vessels, with 282 guns
      and 3500 men, under flag-officer Mervin.

      This Congress authorized a loan of $ 170,000,000; but made no effort at
      all to negotiate a loan abroad, as it was well understood that English
      capitalists were passively hostile to the war, and, so far as they could
      consistently, favored the Southern Confederacy. With them cotton was king,
      and from the first moment of its life the Southern Confederacy did what it
      could to increase the love between King Cotton and his British admirers.
      Indeed, it was felt all over the North (and hoped for in the South) that
      there was some danger of European interference, since the desire for
      cotton, the eagerness for free trade, and the hope of immediate gain might
      prompt to an interference which the aristocratic element of Great Britain,
      and the friends of despotism in France, would have rejoiced to see
      undertaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after the United States government had given notice to other
      nations of the blockading of Southern ports, efforts were made to break or
      disregard it. Liverpool merchants claimed that, under the treaty between
      this country and Great Britain, they had the right to enter any port of
      the United States, and that the attempt to enforce the blockade against
      British ships was an infringement of national law. The English government
      having already recognized the blockade as a belligerent right, the British
      minister in reply told the Liverpool merchants that "if any British ship,
      being a neutral, knowingly attempts to break an effective blockade, she is
      liable to capture and condemnation."
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding this notification, scores of British merchants resolved to
      take the risk of running the blockade, because of the immense profits to
      be made therefrom. To buy cotton for ten cents, and then sell it for
      thirty cents, per pound, and then to pay the ten cents in arms,
      accoutrements, and other English manufactured goods, on which they could
      make a profit of at least one hundred per cent., were opportunities which
      seldom occurred, and which, in-their estimation, would justify great
      risks. Nor were British merchants the only ones who took this view of the
      case, as the sequel of this history will show. The merchants and other
      moneyed men of New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore were just as eager
      for the "almighty dollar," and were quite as ready to take risks to obtain
      it. The risk was lessened from the fact that the coast to be guarded
      extended over three thousand miles; that the number of vessels to guard it
      (heretofore given) were but few in proportion to the length of coast; and
      that the Southern Confederacy was as anxious to have them bring their
      goods and take their cotton in exchange, as English and Northern merchants
      'were to do it. Every Confederate fort and every Confederate soldier was
      ready to render all the aid possible to every blockade runner, no matter
      whether from London, Liverpool, Nassau, New York, Philadelphia, or
      Baltimore. As an evidence of the extent to which trade by blockade running
      was carried on, it has been estimated that the amount of ships and cargoes
      sent in by English capitalists to the one port of Wilmington, N. C., from
      January, 1863, to December, 1864, amounted to $66,000,000. What,
      meanwhile, was the extent of trade between Wilmington and other Southern
      ports with New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore capitalists is not known,
      but probably as great, if not greater, than with English capitalists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another fact, which greatly contributed to blockade running and other
      clandestine trade, was that all through the North there were warm
      sympathizers with the South&mdash;some of whom had been born in the South,
      others had relatives and friends there, others had had extensive business
      relations with Southern men, and still others sympathized with the South
      from a political standpoint&mdash;each and all of whom were ready to help
      the South in any way they could; and yet to save themselves from censure,
      if not from arrest, felt obliged to call themselves "Union" men. These men
      were everywhere, and often where least suspected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kattell, in his "History of the Great Rebellion," in writing of the
      difficulties under which President Lincoln's administration labored for
      the first few months, says: "The diplomatic corps abroad and the
      incumbents of office at the North were most of them inclined to thwart the
      action of the new administration, and in their train was a large number of
      active men on whom the government could not depend, if it had no
      opposition to encounter. The new administration found itself thus
      completely in the power of the secession party, and all its secrets, from
      the cabinet debates to the details of orders, were known to the South. The
      bureaus of the departments, the judiciary, the army and navy, and the
      offices were all filled with persons who were eagerly watching to catch up
      and transmit every item of information that might aid the Confederates, or
      thwart the government."
    </p>
    <p>
      The above is true so far as it goes, but it is only a very small part of
      the whole truth&mdash;not the one hundredth part of what we now know to be
      true, some parts of which will be told in the following pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Macaulay's description of the condition of England, immediately preceding
      the signing of the treaty of Rys-wick, portrays the condition of the
      United States government during a portion, if not during the whole time of
      the war, quite as well as if written for the purpose. He says: "Her secret
      enemies had commanded her fleets and armies, had ministered at her altars,
      had taught at her universities, had swarmed in her public offices, had sat
      in her Parliament, had bowed and fawned in the bedchamber of her King."
      The facts and incidents hereafter to be related will show, in part, and
      would show wholly, if all were told that is known, that what Macaulay says
      of the condition of England from 1689 to 1697, was no less true of the
      United States from 1861 to 1865. Of course, all this inured greatly to the
      benefit of the Southern Confederacy, but was as greatly detrimental to the
      United States government, and at times made final success seem very
      doubtful, if not impossible.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      BRAINS AND CAUTION SHIFTING THE SCENES.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE battle of
      Gettysburg, fought on the 2d and 3d of July, 1863, was one of the most
      important, if not <i>the</i> most important, battle of the whole war. The
      conflict had now been going on for over two years with varying success.
      Each side had used its utmost efforts for success, and to the general
      public the end seemed no nearer than in the beginning; but those behind
      the scenes saw things in a different light, and especially was this true
      of President Davis and his cabinet. While he and they well understood the
      advantages of keeping up a fair outside show, they knew equally well that
      the proportion of strength had greatly changed between the North and the
      South. Commencing with proportions of two to one (20 to 10) they had
      reached the proportions of three to one (15 to 5), and another such battle
      as that which had just occurred&mdash;in which the losses on both sides
      were immense, and in which both sides thought themselves defeated, and
      were making preparations for retreat on the day following&mdash;would make
      the disproportion still greater.
    </p>
    <p>
      They knew, too, that every day made their situation more and more
      desperate; that every day increased the effectiveness of the blockade;
      that food, clothing, and all the necessaries of life were every day
      becoming scarcer; and while they still had almost any quantity of cotton,
      they knew the people could not eat that, and unless some new source of
      nutrition for the Confederacy could be opened, it must soon succumb from
      mere exhaustion. To add still further to the difficulty, their
      communication with the North seemed about to be cut off entirely. Up to
      that time their letters from their Northern sympathizers, from England,
      and from other parts of the world, had reached them through
      blockade-runners, mostly by the way of Nassau; but the recent capture of
      some of these blockade-runners, and the stricter watch now kept by the
      United States blockading squadron, made this source look more and more
      doubtful, and certainly less and less reliable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Davis, when United States Senator and when Secretary of War, had
      credit for brains and great shrewdness; but never did he need them so much
      as now, and as "necessity is the mother of invention," the fact of the
      need called forth from his fertile brain a plan of domestic diplomacy
      which would have done credit to Pitt in his palmiest days. However good a
      conception or plan may be, still it is of no use unless it can be put into
      execution, and just here was President Davis's greatest trouble. He had
      scores of officers about him ready to do his slightest bidding, but among
      them all he could think of no one exactly fitted for the kind of service
      he then had in view. When in his greatest distress of mind, walking the
      floor for hours at a time, thinking, thinking, thinking, it happened that
      Colonel Ralph Abercrombie, who was in command of a Louisiana regiment in
      General A. P. Hill's corps, came into Richmond, and, as was his custom,
      called immediately at the executive mansion. The Colonel had been known to
      Mr. and Mrs. Davis since a boy. Mr. Davis, when Secretary of War, had
      appointed him to a lieutenancy in the regular army. Both Mr. and Mrs.
      Davis were on the most intimate terms with his widowed mother, and though
      the Colonel was now about thirty years of age, they still called him
      Ralph.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, on this visit, he observed the President's anxiety, he naturally
      inquired the cause, and soon learned from Mr. Davis the outlines of his
      plan. The Colonel at once offered his services to put the President's plan
      into execution, only suggesting that, instead of opening the route to
      Washington via Chesapeake Bay and Leonardstown, Md., he would prefer a
      more northern route, for the reason that he was better acquainted with the
      Potomac between the Great Falls and Cumberland than with the route
      proposed by President Davis. When a lad, he had attended St. James'
      College, near Hagerstown, Md., and, by frequent drives through the
      country, had learned every foot of ground between that point and
      Washington city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Davis listened attentively, and when the Colonel had finished, he
      quickly replied that his offer of services had relieved his mind of a
      great anxiety; that he would accept them most gladly; and that he would
      agree to any route upon which the Colonel might fix. He told the Colonel,
      in addition, that he would appoint, to assist him, any one whom he might
      name, and that in opening and establishing the route he could employ
      whoever he pleased, and use any amount of funds that might seem necessary,
      as the project involved millions of money, if not the very life of the
      Confederacy; and that the few thousands it might cost would only be as
      dust in the balance, as compared with the advantages to be gained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Abercrombie immediately turned over the command of his regiment to
      Major Charles Hall (the Lieutenant-Colonel, John H. Black, being on sick
      leave from a wound received at Gettysburg), and entered upon the duty of
      opening this new route to Washington. From Richmond to Orange Court-House
      (General Lee's headquarters) was by rail, and involved no difficulty. From
      thence to the Rapidan River, on the southerly side of which lay the
      Confederate army, and on the northerly side the Union army, was easy
      enough; but from thence, to first get through the Union line of pickets,
      and then traverse about seventy miles of country, until the Potomac was
      reached at or near the Great Falls, about twelve miles above Washington,
      was the tug of war. To establish this latter part of the route involved
      the employment of about twenty men&mdash;some as guides from point to
      point; some to furnish horses, or other conveyances, to the
      blockade-runners and their passenger guests; some to entertain and conceal
      them whenever they came that way; some to be on the constant lookout, and
      pass the word from post to post, if any danger threatened the
      blockade-runners or any of their employees; some to row them across the
      Potomac, and meanwhile keep their boats concealed from the eyes of Union
      troops and guards; and others to pass them through safely from the Great
      Falls to Washington and return. The men so employed included planters or
      farmers, doctors, merchants, and day-laborers, all of whom received pay
      for their services from the Confederacy, through the hands of Colonel
      Abercrombie or Colonel Kill-gore. Besides these, the guides had under pay
      three old negro women, at whose huts they stopped and concealed themselves
      and guests, whenever occasion required. At Great Falls, Messrs. Garrett
      &amp; Morse, merchants, were the principal agents. Upon them depended
      mainly the keeping open of the line from that point to Washington city;
      the crossing of the Potomac at or near that point; and to see that the
      guides on the Virginia side of the Potomac were always ready for service.
      At Washington city the grand depot, or end of the line, was at Ben
      Beveridge's saloon, and the "Washington House," kept by Ben's mother, at
      the corner of Third Street and Pennsylvania Avenue. Ben furnished the
      disguises for both conductors and passengers on this line, and was always
      ready to lend a helping hand in any way in which his services could be
      made available. His first advance pay for services was two thousand
      dollars in gold, to which additions were made from time to time until he
      received from eight thousand to ten thousand dollars, all in gold. All
      these men were in entire sympathy with the Southern Confederacy, and
      nearly all offered their services gratuitously when first spoken to on the
      subject by Colonel Abercrombie; but his plan was to bind every man to
      greater faithfulness by having him to accept pay from the Confederacy, and
      hence he would not accept of gratuitous service from any one. How many
      thousands or tens of thousands of dollars were distributed by Colonel
      Abercrombie and Colonel Killgore, for the Confederacy, in this service, we
      are unable to say, but certainly a good many. It took about six weeks of
      faithful service for Colonel Abercrombie to open this new line, and, when
      completed, he returned to Richmond and reported to President Davis that
      the line was now ready for business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Davis approved of all that had been done, and asked Colonel
      Abercrombie whom he would have as an assistant. The Colonel named his
      personal friend, Colonel Newton Killgore, who was then on detached service
      at Charleston, S. C. Killgore was a graduate of West Point, and a
      Lieutenant in the Topographical Engineer Corps, U. S. A., previous to the
      breaking out of the war. He was then about twenty-seven years of age,
      active, energetic, wide-awake, and just the man, as Colonel Abercrombie
      thought, for such service. Mr. Davis sent for him, and after explaining
      the kind of service to be done, placed him upon the duty, and directed him
      to hold himself in constant readiness for orders, which he did from that
      time forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first service, on this new line, required by President Davis of
      Colonel Abercrombie, was to carry eleven letters to, and open personal
      negotiations with, Major Weightman, of Washington; George Thomas, John P.
      Grundy, Alexander Gibson, of Baltimore; Dr. Charles Howell, C. C. Pollard,
      George J. Platt, of Philadelphia; Mr. McLane, President of the New York
      Pacific Mail Steamship Company, Mr. Waddell, of the same company, and John
      Lamb and Alexander Goldsmith, brokers, of New York city.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Major Weightman Mr. Davis had been on most intimate terms of
      friendship for many years. Both were Mississippians, both had been in the
      Mexican war, where Major Weightman gained considerable notoriety, was
      badly wounded, returned home, married a rich lady at Jackson, Miss, (a
      Miss Willowby), resigned his commission in the regular army, removed to
      Washington, and from thenceforth lived a quiet, retired life in that city.
      When the war broke out between the North and South, Major Weightman still
      continued his residence in Washington city, and soon became on most
      intimate terms with Secretary Seward and President Lincoln. When rallied
      about his position, he always replied that he was "a Union man," and there
      left it. His word was regarded as law, and no one questioned him further.
      Meanwhile, however, all his sympathies were with the South, and he was in
      almost constant communication with Mr. Davis. Through him Mr. Davis first
      learned of these other gentlemen to whom he now wrote, and with some of
      whom he had, after learning of them, kept up a correspondence. Mr. Davis
      now wanted arms, provisions, clothing, while these gentlemen, he knew,
      wanted cotton, and the object of the present letters and negotiations was
      to exchange the one for the other&mdash;to the great advantage of the
      Confederacy, and with immense profit to those who might take part in the
      speculation. The Confederacy had taken in exchange for bonds, had taken
      for taxes, and had otherwise become in possession of millions upon
      millions of dollars' worth of cotton. The gentlemen to whom these letters
      were addressed possessed, or could control, millions upon millions of
      dollars in money, and with this money could purchase what the South then
      stood so much in need of&mdash;arms, food, and clothing. The cotton was
      greatly needed by American and English manufacturers, and could be sold at
      a price five times greater than Mr. Davis would sell it to them for. On
      the goods which they would exchange for the cotton, immense profits could
      be made. The only difficulty was in getting the cotton out of the
      Confederacy, or in securing it from destruction while it had to remain
      there. To effect this they must either run the blockade, or so cajole
      President Lincoln, his cabinet, and his generals in the field as to secure
      the cotton whenever the Union armies reached the places where the cotton
      was deposited. The risk in all this was considerable, but the immense
      profits to be gained far more than overbalanced the risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching Washington, Colonel Abercrombie went directly to the house of
      Major Weightman. The two soon after met at Ben Beveridge's, and then and
      there negotiated for a suite of rooms in the "Washington House," to be all
      the time kept for the agents of, and all the while paid for by, the
      Southern Confederacy. An order for two thousand dollars in gold was handed
      Ben Beveridge at once, as an earnest of what he might expect if he proved
      faithful and true. Three days after, Major Weightman and Colonel
      Abercrombie went to Baltimore to call upon Mr. George Thomas. After the
      delivery of President Davis's letter, and a general talk over the matters
      to which the letter referred, Mr. Thomas concluded to call together a few
      well known Southern sympathizers at a dinner-party next day, when and
      where the whole subject could be thoroughly canvassed. The dinner came off
      next day, as proposed, and around the table were gathered the following
      well-known gentlemen: Mr. George Thomas, John P. Grundy, Dr. Leslie
      Buckler, Alexander R. Gibson, Major Weightman, Colonel Abercrombie, James
      Wilson, J. W. Jenkins. The result of this conference was entirely in favor
      of President Davis's wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day Major Weightman and Colonel Abercrombie, accompanied by Mr. James
      Wilson, went to Philadelphia, and called at once upon Dr. Charles Howell,
      then living on Rittenhouse Square. After delivery of letters and talking
      over matters somewhat, Dr. Howell, like Mr. Thomas, decided to call
      together at a dinner-party next day a few well known Southern
      sympathizers, when and where the whole subject could be thoroughly
      discussed. This was done, and the following gentlemen were present: Dr.
      Charles Howell, C. C. Pollard, George J. Platt, Philip Swift, Charles H.
      Mason, Jacob Florence, Major Weightman, Colonel Abercrombie, and Messrs
      McLane, Lamb, and Waddell, of the New York Pacific Mail Steamship Co., who
      had been invited by telegraph. Here, too, the result of the conference was
      entirely favorable to Mr. Davis's wishes; but, before a final conclusion
      of the negotiations, it was deemed best that Messrs Lamb and Waddell
      should accompany Colonel Abercrombie back to Richmond, see President Davis
      personally, take a general trip through the Confederate States, and, on
      their return, report to an adjourned meeting. Meanwhile, whatever funds
      Mr. Davis might need should be furnished Major Weightman, to be deposited
      by him with Mr. Riggs, the banker at Washington, to the credit of the
      Southern Confederacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      These arrangements were all satisfactory to Colonel Abercrombie except the
      piloting of Messrs. Lamb and Waddell through the Union lines to Richmond.
      This, he feared, would be a difficult, if not an impossible, task.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he recognized the fact that both these gentlemen might sit in their
      Wall Street banking-offices with all the dignity of a Sir Josiah Child, or
      grace a lady's parlor with all the urbanity of a Lord Chesterfield, yet he
      feared that when disguised as farmers or day-laborers, when required to
      tug along on foot for several miles at a time, and then ride, pell-mell,
      on horseback for a score of miles at a time; when compelled to sleep in
      garrets or in the loft of a negro-hut; when required to prevaricate, or
      even to lie, in order to get by a Union sentinel, they might not be quite
      equal to the occasion. The Colonel tried to persuade them to go by the way
      of Nassau, and from there run the blockade into Charleston, as he himself
      had done when he first entered the Confederate States; but the more he
      tried to persuade them to this course, the more determined they were to go
      with him. Over the difficulties and hardships mentioned by the Colonel,
      they only laughed, said they could stand it all, that it would be as
      holiday-sport to them, and that, in a day or two, both would meet the
      Colonel at Ben Beveridge's, in Washington, and from thence make their way
      with him to Richmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third day after, Messrs. Lamb and Waddell were in Washington, and that
      night, between eleven and twelve o'clock, left Beveridge's, <i>en route</i>
      for Richmond. Ben and Weightman accompanied them to a Mr. Thecker's house,
      in Georgetown, where the disguises were to be put on. Lamb first placed
      himself in the hands of the manipulators. He had been wearing long chin
      whiskers; these Ben cut off at one fell swoop, leaving his face as bare as
      a child's. Next, his hair was nicked and chopped over, as if done with a
      pair of sheep-shears, in the hands of a country bumpkin, instead of by a
      Broadway barber. Then he was stripped of his latest-fashioned coat, vest,
      and pants, and in their place was supplied with a suit which would have
      done credit to an ox-team driver. Waddell came next. His magnificent
      beard, covering his entire face, was cut clean off, and, in place thereof,
      two false "mutton-chop" side whiskers and a false moustache, both
      butternut-color, were put on his face. Next, Ben applied the shears to
      Waddell's head, and pretty soon his hair presented the appearance of a
      country ox driver's. Then he, too, was stripped of his Broadway suit, and
      in a few minutes transmogrified into a fat, jolly farmer, or a Conestoga
      team-driver. The Colonel was already in disguise, and had been ever since
      he left his uniform at Mr. Joseph Mix's, about eleven miles within the
      Confederate lines, and now it only required a little touching up, which
      the Colonel did for himself while the others were laughing over their own
      outlandish appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      About one o'clock in the morning all were ready for a start. Ben consented
      to go along until the first guard was passed&mdash;Major Weightman to wait
      at Thecker's until Ben returned. It was the latter part of August, 1863,
      and the nights, just then, were not only very warm, but very dark. Ben led
      the way, Lamb and Waddell followed, and the Colonel served as rear-guard.
      When Ben, who was several hundred yards in advance, reached the
      canal-lock, near which a guard was stationed, he played the drunkard, and
      cursed the lock-tender loud enough for the guard to hear. The lock-tender
      was one of the Colonel's men, and in the pay of the Confederacy. He knew
      Ben's voice, and knew, too, that the Colonel was not far off Ben told the
      lock-tender, in a voice loud enough for the guard to hear, that he had
      plenty of whiskey and plenty of cigars in his pockets, and wondered if the
      guard would n't like some. The lock-tender thought it probable, whereupon
      Ben staggered off towards the guard, flourishing a bottle of whiskey as he
      went, and crying out to the guard, "Don't shoot! Don't shoot!" The bait
      took. The guard gave no challenge&mdash;allowed Ben to approach him&mdash;took
      a good swig of whiskey from Ben's bottle&mdash;lit a cigar which Ben had
      handed him&mdash;entered into a rip-raving-swearing conversation with Ben;
      and, while all this was going on, the Colonel and his guests slipped
      quietly by, and were a good half-mile beyond the guard before Ben bade him
      good-night.

      A further walk on the tow-path of the Chesapeake and Ohio canal, for over
      two miles, brought the three travellers to Widow Ennis's farm- and
      lock-house. She was in the pay of the Confederacy; and within a half-hour
      from the time of reaching there, the three travellers were in the saddle,
      and, accompanied by her son, to bring the horses back, on their way to the
      Great Falls. They rode along at a brisk trot, and part of the time the New
      York gentlemen were nearer the ears than the tails of their horses,
      nevertheless they managed to hold on, and, after a ride of nine miles,
      reached Hendrickson's, about a half-mile from the Falls. Here they
      dismounted. Joseph took the horses back to his mother's stable, while our
      three travellers walked on, about one mile, until they reached the
      garden-fence in the rear of the hotel, which they clambered over, or
      through, and finally got into the back-building of the hotel, through a
      private door. The Colonel knew all the points, and Lamb and Waddell had
      only to follow him to secure themselves and him from observance by the
      Union sentinel, whose station was but a little way from the front of the
      hotel. At Hendrickson's they left the main road, and followed a by-path
      until they reached the garden in the rear of the hotel. In creeping
      through the garden-fence, Waddell tore his coat badly about the shoulder,
      which distressed him not a little, and for which he was heartily laughed
      at by his companions. Mr. Morse, who kept the hotel, was soon with his
      back-door customers, and certainly no guests ever received a more hearty
      welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great Falls, it may here be said, once for all, is neither a town nor a
      village; but consists of a large three-story stone building, used as a
      hotel for summer visitors, and as a private residence in the winter, and a
      large store-building, with numerous out-houses, used for transportation
      purposes&mdash;all of which belong to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal
      Company; but were at this time rented, and the business carried on by
      Messrs. Garrett &amp; Morse, the former of whom gave more especial
      attention to the store, and the latter to the hotel. Both were
      Marylanders; both sympathized heartily with the Southern cause, though
      nominally "strong Union men;" both were under the pay of the Confederacy;
      and both, or as a firm, received from the Southern Confederacy, at
      different times, through the hands of Colonels Abercrombie and Killgore,
      sums in gold amounting to between six and eight thousand dollars. Both
      were first-class business men, of high character, and, from their love of
      the Southern cause, would, doubtless, have rendered it all the aid they
      could had they not received one cent of pay; but such was not the policy
      of President Davis or his agents. They insisted that all who aided should
      be paid, and so long as cotton could be converted into gold, this was
      possible, and certainly the true policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now about three o'clock in the morning, but the Colonel would not
      retire until he had sent for, and consulted with, Garrett, as to future
      movements. From him the Colonel learned that the line was open, and in
      good working order, that guide No. 1 would be on hand the next night to
      row them across the Potomac, and conduct them to guide No. 2, and that,
      meanwhile, all three should retire, and keep themselves entirely out of
      sight until the following night. The retiring and resting part suited Lamb
      and Waddell exactly. Both were thoroughly tired from their long walk and
      horseback ride, neither being at all used to that kind of exercise. Lamb
      was then about fifty, Waddell about forty years of age; the first was
      lean, the latter fat; both knew how to handle gold and greenbacks, but
      neither knew how to handle reins or sit a saddle, especially when on the
      back of a rough trotting country farm-horse. Their feet would slip through
      the stirrups; in descending hill, they would, somehow or other, slip from
      their saddles towards the ears of their horses; and in going up hill it
      was with difficulty they kept from slipping off their saddles towards
      their horses' tails. They knew how to walk Broadway and Wall Street with
      as much grace as a French dancing-master; but when it came to walking on
      the tow-path of a canal, to creeping through garden-fences, and such like
      performances, neither of them could do it half as well as a country
      clod-hopper. Bed! rest! of course they were ready for bed and rest, and
      the sooner the better; and, suiting the action to the word, both were soon
      in bed, and snoring away for dear life.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some cause or other, guide No. I did not put in an appearance next
      night, and our travellers were obliged to keep themselves concealed for
      another day. The following night, however, he came, and between nine and
      ten o'clock the three slipped out of the back-door of the hotel, made
      their way to the boat, which was in waiting about a mile up the Potomac,
      were rowed across by the guide, then walked about a mile to a negro-hut,
      and then about three miles more to a-farm-house. Here horses were
      procured, and then for about thirty miles, mostly through private lanes
      and pig-paths, through woods and over fields, over torn-down fences and
      through open gates, they trudged along until they reached the farm-house
      of Dr. Carrico. It was now nearly daybreak, and our travellers were
      thoroughly tired out. The Doctor, who was in the pay of the Confederacy,
      though within the Union lines, and nominally a "Union man," received the
      travellers with open arms, and in a little while had them safely tucked
      away in bed-chambers, where the eye of no chance Union soldier or visitor
      could see them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here they remained until the next night. Then with a new guide (guide No.
      2 having returned with the horses) they left Dr. Carrico's shortly after
      nightfall, and, upon horses furnished by the Doctor, rode about thirty-two
      miles to the farm and mill of Mr. Henry Budd. In this long ride, like the
      other, most of the way had to be made through private roads and pig-paths,
      as Union forces were in all that country, and on the public highways there
      was danger of meeting Union cavalry or infantry, as patrols or sentinels,
      at any moment. It was about three o'clock in the morning when they reached
      Budd's mills. Just before reaching there our travellers dismounted, and
      the horses were slipped into Budd's stable, as there was a Union sentinel
      at this mill who could not be passed on horseback, and with whom some
      diplomacy had to be used to get by at all. To effect this, the Colonel,
      Lamb, and Waddell approached as near the mill as possible, and then
      secreted themselves, while the guide (No. 3) went forward to interest the
      sentinel in conversation, until they could slip by. The guide knew
      everybody in that neighborhood, and fortunately, knew the sentinel, so
      that with lively conversation, and an occasional drink from a well-filled
      canteen, he soon had the sentinel so engrossed that the three travellers
      stepped across the mill-race, slipped around on the other side of the
      mill, and soon were a good half-mile beyond the sentinel. Here they waited
      in a woods for their guide to come up. He, on the plea that he was going
      to see an "uncle", on the other side, got away from the sentinel erelong,
      and soon after overtook the three travellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the point where the guide rejoined them, all four walked to the
      farm-house of Mr. Jonathan Brisco, about four miles from Budd's mill. Here
      a Union sentinel had been placed as a safeguard, while easterly and
      westerly from the house, sentinels were placed only a little way apart.
      This was the extreme outer line of the Union army, and was guarded, of
      course, with extra vigilance. If once through this line our travellers
      thenceforth would be within the lines of the Confederate army and entirely
      safe, but just how to get through was now the problem to be solved. The
      plan resolved upon was that Colonel Abercrombie, Lamb, and Waddell should
      remain concealed some distance from the house, while the guide should go
      forward and make arrangements with the sentinel to allow the three to come
      up and go into the house to see his "uncle," and then, while he interested
      the guard with lively conversation and occasional drinks of whiskey, the
      three to slip out of the back-door, down through the garden, over a
      meadow, through a creek, and as far and as fast as possible in the pines
      beyond. The plan all worked like a charm, except that while the three were
      making their way from the house the sentinel chanced to observe them. He
      at once asked the guide what it meant. The guide replied that they were
      going to another neighbor's house, a little beyond, to see about some
      corn, and would soon return to remain the balance of the night with his
      "uncle." The sentinel still seemed troubled about having let the three men
      pass his post, and the guide, seeing this, and wanting to keep in the good
      graces of the Union sentinel, as he might need his services again, slipped
      fifty dollars in gold (which the Colonel had handed him for the purpose)
      into the sentinel's hand, which at once eased his mind and made everything
      seem exactly right.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this point the three travellers walked about six miles to Mr. Andrew
      Mitchell's. Here they procured horses, mounted at once, and rode thirteen
      miles, to Mr. Walter Randolph's, near a railroad station called China
      Grove, about ten miles north-easterly from Orange Court House. Probably no
      three travellers ever rejoiced more over the completion of a trip than
      these three on reaching China Grove station. They were now among friends,
      and from this point they could go by railroad to Richmond. The Colonel
      soon doffed his disguise, and was again in the uniform he had left there
      when on his way to Washington. Messrs. Lamb and Waddell could not procure
      new suits until they reached Richmond, and therefore had to content
      themselves with the old until then. About ten o'clock the cars came along,
      our three travellers jumped aboard, and within an hour were at Orange
      Court-House, seated around the best breakfast that mine host of Freeman's
      Hotel could get up. At two p.m. they took the cars for Richmond, and
      before nightfall were at the Spottsylvania Hotel, in the capital of the
      Southern Confederacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning early, Messrs. Lamb and Waddell were in quest of new suits,
      which they obtained from a readymade clothing-store, not far from the
      hotel. Next, they went to Mowrey's banking-house to exchange some of their
      gold for Confederate notes, which at that time was exchangeable at the
      rate of eight dollars in Confederate notes for one dollar in gold. Then
      they returned to the hotel, and soon after were introduced to President
      Davis's private secretary, N. Burton Harris, Esq. He took them to the
      Executive Mansion and introduced them to Mr. Davis. With him they had a
      long conference on business affairs, after which he introduced them to and
      put them in special care of certain prominent gentlemen at the capital,
      whose duty and pleasure it would be to give them such additional
      information as they might need, and accompany them to such other cities of
      the Confederacy as they might desire to visit. The Colonel called upon the
      President the same evening, made a full report of all that he had seen and
      heard and done while at the North, and then left to visit his regiment,
      which lay near Gordonsville.
    </p>
    <p>
      Messrs. Lamb and Waddell, after spending a few more days in and about
      Richmond, seeing what was to be seen and learning what was to be learned,
      left for Newbern, Wilmington, Charleston, Savannah, Mobile, and other
      places where Confederate cotton was in store. At all these points they
      found immense quantities of cotton, some of which they were told had been
      seven years gathered, and held meanwhile for better prices. At each place
      they found government agents, and others, who assured them that the cotton
      could be got through the blockade, if they only had ships on which to load
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      They saw, too, at every place they visited, a determined spirit on the
      part of the people never to give over the struggle, until their separation
      was achieved. Of course they did not see, and great care was taken that
      they should not see, anything like destitution among the people. The
      tables which they saw were all well spread, though it took the last loaf
      of bread from the pantry or the last pickle from the jar. It was a part of
      the masterly diplomacy of President Davis, and of those who surrounded and
      upheld his hands, never to show a want, or cry <i>peccavi</i>, where a
      Northern ear could see the one or hear the other. "Not one cent for
      tribute, but millions for defence," was their cry from first to last,&mdash;was
      their cry, indeed, until, when the egg was finally broken, nothing was
      found but an empty shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having finished their journey through the States of the Confederacy,
      occupying between two and three weeks, Messrs Lamb and Waddell returned to
      Richmond and reported to President Davis that they were entirely satisfied
      with what they had seen and heard, and that, so soon as they could report
      the facts to Messrs McLane, Thomas, Howell, and others, there would be no
      difficulty whatever in his obtaining all the money and all the supplies he
      might at any time need in exchange for cotton. Colonel Abercrombie was
      then telegraphed for, and on the day following reported at the Executive
      Mansion. From the President he received full instructions as to further
      operations. He then informed Messrs Lamb and Waddell that he was now ready
      to conduct them back to Washington. Next day they started by rail for
      China Grove station. Here, at Mr. Randolph's, they exchanged uniform and
      fashionable suits for their former disguises, and from thence traversed
      about the same route, rode and walked about the same distances, met with
      about the same incidents as when on the outward trip, until they finally
      reached Ben Beveridge's in Washington city. Here they met Major Weightman
      and informed him of all they had seen and learned. Then on to Baltimore,
      where they called upon, and reported to, Mr. Thomas and his associates.
      From this point the Colonel returned to Washington, while Messrs Lamb and
      Waddell went on to Philadelphia, where they reported to Dr. Howell and his
      associates; and then to New York, where they reported to Mr. McLane and
      others. All to whom they reported expressed entire satisfaction as to the
      result of their trip, and were ready to invest in the enterprise to the
      extent of their means. Not long after, a general meeting of all the
      "cotton ring" associates was held at Dr. Howell's, in Philadelphia, when
      plans were perfected to charter or purchase ships to send to Newbern,
      North Carolina, to be freighted with needed articles outward and cotton
      inward. It so happened that three of their vessels were seized by the
      blockading squadron, not many weeks after, and this for a time threw a
      cloud over their enterprise; but so soon as the loss was reported to Mr.
      Davis he gave them enough additional cotton to make up for the loss of the
      three vessels and their cargoes. From thenceforth they met with but few,
      if any, losses, though they continued operations, at various points along
      the coast, until the fall of Fort Fisher, on the 15th of January, 1865.
      How much the "ring" made in their cotton operations it would be impossible
      to say; but we have it from an intimate friend of Mr. Gilmore Meredith's,
      of Baltimore, that his share of the profits amounted to a "million of
      money," and if his share reached that amount, others, whose investments
      were far greater, must have reaped still larger amounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      This cotton ring, made up of the gentlemen whom we have heretofore named
      as seated around the dinner-tables of Messrs. Thomas and Howell (besides
      Messrs. Gilmore Meredith, of Baltimore, Samuel Harding, Alphonso
      Lip-pincott, and Alexander Goldsmith, of New York), must not be confounded
      with the one, or more, mentioned by General L. C. Baker, chief of the
      national detective police, in his letter of January 30, 1865, to Hon. E.
      B. Wash-burne, chairman of committee on commerce, in which the names of
      Thurlow Weed, Ward Lamon, Leonard I. Sweat, Wm. P. Dole, D. Randolph
      Martin, B. F. Camp, Prescott Smith, A. H. Lazare, H. A. Risley, T. C.
      Durant, Samuel Norris, and Simeon Draper, occur as playing principal
      parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      These last named gentlemen were nearly all avowed Republicans, and several
      of them personal and intimate friends of President Lincoln and Secretary
      Seward. The others were mostly avowed Southern sympathizers (though
      nominally "Union men"), and some of them had long known, and been on most
      intimate personal terms with, President Davis, besides having friends and
      relatives scattered all over the South. The one had no object but to make
      the almighty dollar. The other had friendship, as well as the almighty
      dollar, as a basis for action. Which of the two is most to be commended,
      or most to be condemned, each reader must decide for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And before closing this chapter we again beg to say&mdash;as stated in the
      introductory chapter&mdash;that, while vouching for facts, we cannot in
      every instance vouch for the names and dates given throughout this volume.
      Our informants in every case meant to give us exact names and exact dates;
      but the many years elapsing between the events and the relating of them to
      us, had caused a partial forgetting of names and dates, although the
      incidents remained as fresh in the minds of the relators as though they
      had occurred but the day before. In second and all subsequent editions of
      this work, these errors (if such there be) will stand corrected, for so
      soon as this work gets before the public, errors, if any there be, will
      doubtless be observed and corrected by such as were, or are, cognizant of
      the facts. The author most earnestly invites such corrections, or any
      others that may be found in the work, as his aim from the first has been
      to "set down naught in malice," nor to say anything of anybody, or in the
      relating of any event, but what is strictly true.

      CHAPTER IV. ANOTHER CONDUCTOR ON THE NEW LINE. CAUTION SLIDING THE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      SCENES.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N the preceding
      chapter, mention is made of the fact that President Davis placed Colonel
      Newton Killgore on this same service; and in the same paragraph a brief
      account is given of his accomplishments, and the position he held in the
      United States army previous to the war. In this chapter we purpose to give
      a bird's-eye view of his services as conductor on this new line, for
      running the land blockade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after the time when Colonel Abercrombie had started on his first
      trip for Washington, President Davis sent for Colonel Killgore, and
      desired him to carry an order for arms and ammunition to Major Weightman,
      of Washington. He was directed, however, to await, at China Grove station,
      Colonel Abercrombie's return to that point, and then to go on or return to
      Richmond, according as the negotiation of Colonel Abercrombie had been
      successful or otherwise. Accordingly, when Messrs. Abercrombie, Lamb, and
      Waddell reached Mr. Randolph's, they found Colonel Killgore awaiting them.
      A consultation resulted in sending him forward on his mission with all
      convenient speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      His general route was the same as that over which our three travellers had
      just passed; his stopping places the same; his guides the same; and in due
      time he found himself in the rooms of the Confederacy at Ben Beveridge's.
      Ben sent for Major Weightman. To him Colonel Killgore delivered his
      orders, letters, and verbal messages; received from the Major whatever of
      information and messages he had to send to President Davis, and within six
      hours was ready to start on his return trip for Richmond. He returned as
      he went, and within five days from the time of leaving Washington stood in
      the presence of Mr. Davis, ready to give an account of his mission.
      Everything had been done to the entire satisfaction of the President, and
      the Colonel was directed to hold himself in constant readiness for like
      orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, Colonel Killgore made frequent trips between Richmond and
      Washington. Of course he wore a disguise, and acted the part of a green
      country bumpkin: and so well did he wear the one, and assume the other,
      that never, but on two occasions, did he meet with incidents worthy of
      special record.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of these occurred as follows: After delivering messages and
      documents to Major Weightman, he proceeded to Baltimore, to deliver others
      to Mr. Thomas. While at the Fountain Hotel it chanced that his false
      moustache became loose, or somewhat disarranged. He stepped before a
      mirror, in the public reading-room, to readjust it, and, while doing so,
      observed a gentleman watching him very closely. Leaving that hotel
      instantly, he went to Barnum's, but was scarcely there before he noticed
      the same gentleman, who had watched him in the other hotel, again eyeing
      him closely. Soon the gentleman stepped up to him, and called him by his
      first name. The Colonel immediately recognized him as an old army friend,
      whom he had not seen for many years, and whom he had little thought to
      meet there, and under such circumstances. The gentleman was a Southerner;
      recognized, and entirely approved of the Colonel's new position as
      Ambassador Extraordinary between high contracting parties; and in a little
      while after they were drinking the health of each other, and confusion to
      their enemies. The Colonel at first feared that one of Baker's detectives
      had discovered his disguise while he was arranging his moustache, as
      before related, and felt not a little relieved when his observer turned
      out to be a friend instead of an enemy. He never again adjusted his false
      moustache in the reading-room of a hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other incident occurred as follows: He had been to Washington, and was
      on his return to Richmond. Crossing the Potomac, at a point above the
      Great Falls, he was accosted by a man on the Virginia side, who wanted to
      know where he had come from, and where he was going? Colonel Killgore
      replied that he lived in Maryland, not far from the Falls, and was on his
      way to visit a friend on the Virginia side. Other conversation followed,
      until the Colonel thought his questioner was satisfied, though he
      meanwhile had fully made up his mind that his questioner was none other
      than one of General Baker's secret detectives. The Colonel finally bade
      his questioner good-bye, and started to leave, when his questioner cried
      out, "Stop! I believe you are a spy&mdash;you are my prisoner!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I am not!" answered Colonel Killgore, and instantly sent a bullet
      whizzing into the brain of his questioner. The man fell, and died at once.
      An examination of the papers upon his person proved him to be, as the
      Colonel had suspected, one of the captains of General Baker's National
      Detective force. His body was left precisely where it fell, while Colonel
      Killgore proceeded on his journey, and in due time arrived in Richmond.
      When the body of the captain was found, some days after, it was discovered
      that a bullet had pierced his brain; but it was not known then, nor,
      except to a very few, was it ever known afterwards, who sent it there.
      This is the first publication of the real facts of the case, though the
      newspapers of the time were full of suppositions, not one of which was
      true, or anywhere near true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Killgore continued one of the conductors on this line until the
      line was closed. After the war he returned to Charleston, studied law, was
      admitted to practice, and when last heard from was doing a large and
      successful business, and was regarded as among the first men of the State.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N September, 1863,
      cotton was quoted in New York city at 70 cents, gold at $1.29. The first
      indicated the great want for cotton by the manufacturers of this country,
      of England, and of other parts of the world. The second indicated the want
      of confidence, then existing, among the moneyed men of the world in the
      stability of this government.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great divorce trial then going on in the court of last resort&mdash;the
      Court of Arms&mdash;in which the South, as representing the wife, was
      complainant, and the North, as representing the husband, was defendant,
      had thus far been attended with varied success. In the first contest, at
      Fort Sumter, the wife spit fire at the husband, and the husband quickly
      succumbed. In the second contest, at Bull Run, the wife flew at the
      husband's eyes and ears, and he, to save both, ran back to Washington. In
      the next, General Lyon, on behalf of the father, made a dash at General
      Price, at Booneville, Mo., when the latter suddenly remembered that he was
      needed elsewhere and left without ceremony. In Western Virginia, General
      McClellan sprang for the scalp of General Garnett, when the latter
      concluded that some point nearer Richmond would be more healthy. And thus
      the trial had been dragging its slow length along, sometimes favorable to
      the complainant and sometimes to the defendant, up to the time mentioned
      at the opening of this chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the children on both sides only seemed the more determined to
      win finally, the oftener they were defeated temporarily; and criminations
      and recriminations became harsher and fiercer on both sides. The children
      of the North sided with the father, and claimed that the letter of the
      original contract must be kept; that in that contract there was no
      provision for divorce, nor was it admissible now. The children of the
      South sided with the mother, and claimed that the father had ill-treated
      the mother, had outgrown the mother, because of advantages taken of her,
      and by every law, human and divine, she was entitled to a divorce. The
      children of the North claimed that even if a legal divorce was possible,
      an equitable division of the estate was impossible. That a considerable
      portion of the estate had been purchased with blood, or treasure, or both,
      since marriage, and was so located that division was impossible; that
      Texas, California, and New Mexico had cost thousands of lives and one
      hundred and thirty-five millions of dollars, and could not now be divided;
      that Louisiana and the free navigation of the Mississippi River had cost
      fifteen millions of dollars, and could not now be divided; that Florida
      had been purchased of Spain at a cost of six million dollars, and that it
      had cost twenty-five millions more to get the Seminole Indians out of its
      swamps, and that it could not now be divided. To all this the children of
      the South replied, that not only what the mother had brought to the
      estate, but all that had been since obtained, contiguous to that which she
      had before marriage, belonged of right to her and her alone, and that they
      would maintain her in this right against all comers: The children of the
      North further complained that over three millions of the children of the
      common household were held in bondage by Southern masters, and that they
      must be liberated ere we could hope to have permanent peace at home, or
      the respect of nations abroad. The children of the South replied that
      those held in bondage were the descendants of Ham, whom Noah, with God's
      approval, assigned to perpetual bondage to the sons of Shem and Japhet. To
      this the children of the North replied that the New Dispensation of
      Christ, teaching forgiveness to all, kindness to all, love to all, had
      done away with the Old Dispensation of "an eye for an eye and a tooth for
      a tooth," and that the command, "Come unto me all ye ends of the earth,"
      included the black man no less than the white. The children of the South
      replied that they had not brought slavery into the family, nor would they
      drive it out, and if others of the household attempted to do so, they
      would maintain it; and thus, too, this question stood up to the time
      mentioned in the opening of this chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second chapter of this work we mentioned the fact that among the
      first acts of the first Confederate Congress was the authorizing of a loan
      of $15,000,000. Also, the fact that, at a subsequent meeting of the
      Congress at Richmond, President Davis stated in his message that
      "$50,000,000 had been subscribed in cotton." In neither case was it
      officially stated who had subscribed for these loans, but there is
      scarcely a doubt that much the larger part was subscribed by British
      capitalists. English manufacturers wanted the cotton; English capitalists
      wanted a profitable investment for their surplus funds; the sympathies of
      the English nobility and of the upper classes generally were then almost
      wholly with the Southern Confederacy; they believed, as Europeans
      generally believed then, that the South would succeed in establishing a
      separate government; that, whether they succeeded or not, the English
      government would so far interfere as to secure the getting of any cotton
      which English manufacturers and English capitalists might purchase of the
      Confederacy; and, under all these circumstances, it is not at all
      surprising that a large part of the sixty-five millions named should have
      been subscribed for by British subjects; nor is it surprising that after
      they had thus subscribed, and in some cases paid their money in advance by
      cashing Confederate bonds, they should have used extraordinary means&mdash;strange
      and eventful means&mdash;to secure the cotton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus made the frame and stretched on it the canvas, we are now
      ready to paint the picture, and, when finished, it will, we think, fully
      justify the caption given to this chapter, "Nobility after the Nuggets"&mdash;"Diplomacy
      Prompting the Actors."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the latter part of September, 1863, Lord John Brew-erton arrived in the
      city of New York direct from London. So soon as the steamer in which he
      came arrived at the wharf, he directed his valet to have his baggage taken
      to the Astor House, while he, taking the first cab he found at the
      landing, directed the driver to drive him with all possible speed to the
      office of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, 88 Wall Street. On reaching
      the office he inquired for the president of the company, Mr. Allan McLane,
      found him in, and for the next two hours was closeted with him. That same
      evening Mr. McLane called upon Lord Brewerton at the Astor House, dined
      with him, and again spent several hours with him in close and confidential
      conversation&mdash;mostly with regard to the Southern Confederacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two following days Lord Brewerton spent in New York attending to
      various business matters, and on the third day he and Mr. McLane went
      together to Baltimore. At Philadelphia Mr. C. C. Pollard joined them. At
      Baltimore they met Colonel Ralph Abercrombie, who chanced to be in
      Washington at the time, and who had been telegraphed for, through Major
      Weightman, to meet them at Baltimore. That night and the following day
      were spent in consultations with Messrs. Thomas, Grundy, Wilson, and
      others. In the evening McLane and Pollard returned to New York, while Lord
      Brewerton and Colonel Abercrombie went to Washington. They walked from the
      depot direct to Ben Beveridge's, where a scene occurred which is difficult
      to put upon canvas&mdash;a scene much easier imagined than described. When
      the two came into the saloon Ben was absorbed in conversation with some
      gentlemen, and did not see them enter. The Colonel, desiring to attract
      Ben's attention without calling upon himself the attention of others,
      stepped up to the bar and asked for "Bourben whiskey," putting special
      emphasis on the word Bourben, as this was the Confederate password which
      had been agreed upon between him and Ben. The clerk behind the bar sat a
      bottle of Bourbon whiskey upon the marble counter for the Colonel to help
      himself; but still Ben did not come up, and kept on chatting and laughing
      with his friends. The Colonel, determining to attract his attention, put
      the glass to his lips, and then, with an oath loud enough to wake the
      dead, smashed the glass into a thousand pieces on the marble counter, and
      declared that such BOURBEN as that was not fit for a dog to drink. Of
      course, Ben rushed to the counter to see who had dared commit such an
      outrage in his saloon; the Lord shrank back aghast, as though an
      earthquake was about to open under his feet; some Indians who chanced to
      be in the saloon at the time became very much excited and seemed about to
      raise a war-whoop, and, for a moment, confusion worse confounded
      prevailed; but so soon as Ben recognized the Colonel he comprehended the
      whole situation, acknowledged that his clerk had made a mistake in setting
      out some other bottle than "Bourben," made a thousand apologies for the
      mistake, and then, in a tone as mild as that of a sucking-dove, invited
      the Colonel and his friend "John" into a side room, where they might take
      a drink alone by themselves. The outsiders had been completely hoodwinked,
      while the insiders had a hearty laugh all to themselves over the incident
      and its happy ending. Major Weightman was then sent for, and when he came
      he and Lord Brewerton had a conference of some hours. When this had ended,
      a cab was called, and Lord Brewerton was driven direct to the residence of
      the British Minister, Lord Lyons, while the Colonel was driven to his
      sister's (Mrs. Professor Joseph H. Saxton), on Capitol Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Brewerton remained with Lord Lyons some days, and then returned to
      New York, with the expectation of returning at once to England; but, on
      reaching there, he found a cablegram awaiting him which required his
      immediate return to Washington to see Lord Lyons, and, if possible, to
      make his way from thence to Richmond, to see President Davis. He
      accordingly returned next day to Washington, saw the British Minister, saw
      Colonel Abercrombie, and finally succeeded in making arrangements with the
      latter for an overland trip to Richmond. The Colonel explained to him the
      hardships which he would have to endure in making the trip overland, and
      tried hard to persuade him to return to New York and go by the way of
      Nassau; but Lord Brewerton insisted that he could stand the hardships, and
      would much prefer it to a trip by sea. He was at this time about fifty
      years of age, a gentleman of high mental culture, of elegant manners, had
      spent all his life in the very highest walks of society, and had not
      probably ever endured one hour of real hardship; but his health was good,
      and he thought he would rather enjoy, than otherwise, the hardships of
      which the Colonel spoke. At all events, he insisted upon trying it, and so
      the matter was finally agreed upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next night, about ten o'clock, Major Weightman and Colonel Abercrombie
      left Ben Beveridge's saloon in a close carriage; called at the English
      embassy for Lord Brewerton; then on to Thecker's, in Georgetown, where Ben
      was waiting with the disguises. Here, under Ben's skilful hands, Lord
      Brewerton underwent a complete transmogrification. His mutton-chop
      whiskers were cut off; his hair chipped and hacked as though done with a
      broad-axe; his fashionable suit laid aside, and a rough farmer's suit
      substituted; in place of his fine patent leather boots, a pair of negro
      clodhoppers were put upon his feet; in place of his fine beaver, a coarse
      slouch hat; all of which my lord enjoyed and laughed over as heartily as
      the others. The Colonel being in disguise already, it only took a rub or
      two here, and a scrape or two there, to make him ready for the trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      By midnight all were ready. As before, in the case of Lamb and Waddell,
      Ben led the way, and, by playing drunk, and treating the sentinel with
      whiskey and cigars, got them safely by the first post. From there they
      walked about two miles to Widow Ennis' farm-house; thence rode to
      Hendrickson's, nine miles; thence walked to the Falls, one mile. Here
      Garrett and Morse received them with open arms, and furnished such
      refreshments as were needed. Mrs. Morse seemed specially impressed at the
      presence of a live lord, and honored the occasion by putting on her best
      silk dress before coming down-stairs to be introduced. The guide was in
      waiting, and within two hours all three left their friends to cross the
      Potomac. To reach the place where the boat for crossing had been concealed
      required a walk of about two miles; and, when across, it required a walk
      of another mile to reach the negro hut of old "Aunt Rachel." It was now so
      near daylight that the Colonel deemed it unsafe to go further, so that all
      that day the three remained concealed in Aunt Rachel's humble quarters.
      They could not venture outside the door even for a moment, and at times
      the lord seemed in great distress at such close confinement; but the day
      wore away at last, and soon after nightfall the three walked about four
      miles to Mr. Francis Latimer's. Here the Colonel had expected to get
      saddle-horses, as before, but the horses were away, and nothing remained
      in the shape of a conveyance but an old mule, blind in one eye, and a
      two-wheel dirt-cart. After some consultation and delay, it was decided to
      take these, and in a little while after the blind mule and two-wheeled
      cart, with an old darkey, "Uncle Jarrett," as driver, stood before the
      door. Some straw had been thrown in the cart, on which our travellers
      might lay; but Mr. Latimer thought this beneath the dignity of a live
      lord, and therefore had an old splint-bottom chair set in the cart, on
      which the lord might sit, while the Colonel could lay upon the straw at
      his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was very dark, besides which the age and blindness of the mule
      made him to stumble frequently. They had not gone half a mile before Lord
      Brewerton found that his seat was a very uncertain and a very
      uncomfortable one. Down would go one of the wheels into a deep rut. "Ha!
      hi! be careful, my man! be careful! What a bloody road this is, to be
      sure!" the lord would cry out. On a little farther, and down would go the
      other wheel into a deep rut. "Ho! ha! hi! here we go over, to be sure! Be
      careful, my good man; be careful! Why, Colonel, I never saw such bloody
      roads in all my life. Do they ever work them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sometimes," the Colonel replied, as sober as a judge, though almost
      dying from suppressed laughter. Indeed such a scene would have made a dog
      laugh, and surely the blind old mule would have laughed outright could he
      have laughed at all. The Colonel, lying upon the straw on the bottom of
      the cart, felt no fear at all when it sidled over; but Lord Brewerton, on
      the chair, was indeed in danger of being spilled out every time the cart
      made a sudden lurch. A little farther and one of the wheels strikes and
      passes over a good sized stone. "Ha! hi! he! here we go sure this time! Be
      careful, my dear man, be careful! And did you ever see such a bloody road
      in all your life, Colonel? Are you sure, my dear man, that you are in the
      road?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, massa, I'se sure. I knows'em well. I'se trabelled dis road many
      times, massa," replied old Jarrett; and then, turning to his mule, said,
      "Git along, Jack, git along! Lift yer feet high, Jack; lift yer-feet high!
      Git up, git along, Jack!" And thus for full two miles they trudged along,
      the lord in danger every five minutes of being thrown over the wheels, and
      calling everything "bloody! bloody! bloody!" while the Colonel could not
      help occasional outbursts of laughter, though all the while trying to
      suppress it, out of respect for the feelings of Lord John.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Lord Brewerton's patience gave way entirely, when he seized the
      old chair and hurled it from the cart, and then laid down in the straw
      beside the Colonel. The other six miles, to Wilson's mill, were made
      without any incident worthy of record.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Aunt Rachel's negro hut was probably the first in Virginia that ever
      gave shelter for a whole day to a live lord; and it is safe to say that no
      live lord ever rode behind a blinder mule, in a more rickety cart, or with
      a safer driver, than Lord Brewerton did that night. To show his
      appreciation of treats so rare, we may add, that before leaving Aunt
      Rachel he handed her two twenty-dollar gold pieces, and before bidding
      Uncle Jarrett goodbye, he made him happy for life by handing him five
      twenty-dollar gold pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God bless you, massa, God bless you!" was all the answer either of them
      could make to such unexpected generosity; but this, to one whose nature
      was nobler than his blood, was quite sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Wilson's they procured horses, and rode about eight miles to a grove.
      There they dismounted, as it was dangerous to travel the public road
      farther, and sending the horses back with the guide, the two trudged along
      on foot, over fields and through by-paths for about five miles, until they
      reached Mr. Joseph Berry's. Here they stayed all day, and at night rode on
      horseback, about seventeen miles, to Mr. Frederick Hutchings. At this
      farm-house they again changed horses, and then rode six miles farther to
      Nathan Allen's. Again they changed horses, and then rode about fifteen
      miles to Budd's mill. It was now near morning, and for the balance of the
      day they remained concealed in Mr. Budd's house. When night came, they
      managed, as the Colonel had before, to pass the sentinel at the mill, and
      then walked four miles to Mr. Brisco's. Here they obtained horses and rode
      eleven miles to Dr. Charles Worthington's. Here one of the outside Union
      sentinels was stationed. The guide knew him personally, and slipped one
      hundred dollars in gold into his hands. The sentinel became suddenly
      stone-blind, and our travellers passed by without difficulty. They were
      now within the Confederate lines, and no longer in fear of arrest.. After
      a short walk they procured horses, and then a ride of nineteen miles
      brought them to Randolph's, at China Grove station. This route, it will be
      seen, varied some little from that taken by Messrs. Lamb, and Waddell. A
      change of Union troops and sentinel-stations made a change of route
      sometimes necessary. The conductors of the line, Colonels Abercrombie and
      Killgore, had no less than five different points at which they crossed the
      Potomac, and at each point, look-outs and guides were all the while in
      waiting and all the while in the pay of the Confederacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Randolph's, Colonel Abercrombie laid aside his disguise and again
      assumed his uniform; Lord Brewerton brushed up as best he could; both took
      seats in the next passing train; and in a few hours thereafter were at the
      Ballard House, in Richmond. No sooner was Lord Brewerton in his
      bed-chamber than he kneeled (inviting the Colonel to do the same) and
      offered up a most earnest prayer of thanks to God for his deliverance from
      dangers, and for the safety which had attended him thus far in his
      travels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, the arrival of Lord Brewerton was at once made known to Mr.
      Davis, and on the following day the President not only called upon him,
      but insisted that he should make the Executive Mansion his home while he
      remained in Richmond, to which Lord Brewerton finally consented, and at
      once accompanied Mr. Davis to his home. For a day or two they were in
      close consultation. After that, members of the cabinet, army officers, and
      other prominent gentlemen commenced to call upon Lord Brewerton. It was
      soon after arranged that a reception ball should be given him at the
      Executive Mansion. The programme included the illumination of the grounds
      with brilliant fire-works, the attendance of military bands, with special
      invitations to all the leading civil and military officers of the
      Confederacy. The reception and ball came off, and was even more brilliant
      than had been anticipated. Among those present, were Generals Lee,
      Breckenridge, and Beauregard. The ladies, it had been arranged, should all
      dress in calico, from the President's wife down. This was observed to the
      letter, and the lord was given to understand that it was done as a
      compliment to the cotton manufacturing interests of England, though the
      fact was that but few Southern ladies had any of their silks and satins
      left to wear. Although the South, even in the very highest circles of
      society, was beginning to feel the pinch-ings of poverty in dress, food,
      and in almost everything else, yet this was carefully concealed from the
      eyes and ears of Lord Brewerton during the whole time of his stay in the
      Confederacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      About two weeks after the grand ball, Lord Brewerton, accompanied by a few
      friends, started on a tour of inspection through the Confederate States,
      especially to places where cotton was stored in large quantities. They
      visited Wilmington and Newbern, N. C., Charleston, Savannah, Mobile, and
      many other points. The entire trip occupied about two months. On his
      return to Richmond, Lord Brewerton expressed to President Davis and others
      his entire satisfaction with what he had seen and otherwise learned,
      adding that he had not the shadow of a doubt as to the final success of
      the Confederate arms. He assured Mr. Davis that whatever money, arms, and
      provisions the Confederacy might need would be promptly furnished by
      himself and his associates, in exchange for cotton; and that the cause of
      the South would continue to receive, as it had all along received, the
      sympathy and moral support of all the <i>upper</i> classes of England. He
      also assured him that if the ministry of England could have the least
      possible excuse for interfering between the North and the South, they
      would be more than glad to espouse the cause of the South, as England's
      material interests all lay in this direction, and the moral sentiment of
      the nation could not stand for one moment in the way of its moneyed
      interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Brewerton remained in Richmond after his return about one week, in
      consultation with President Davis and his cabinet; Colonel Abercrombie was
      then telegraphed for; all the needed arrangements were made; the two left
      Richmond, and in less than a week were at the English embassy at
      Washington. Their return was by the same route as that on which they had
      gone; walking and riding about the same, except that they missed this time
      a ride behind old Jarrett's blind mule; nor did they have the luxury of
      spending a whole day at Aunt Rachel's negro hut. Lord Brewerton told Lord
      Lyons all about the incidents of their trip (as well as all that he had
      seen and learned of the Confederacy), and the two had over them and their
      wine many a hearty laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened that on the evening following the return of Lord Brewerton
      and Colonel Abercrombie to Washington, there was to be a grand reception
      at the White House. The lord invited the Colonel to accompany him to this
      reception, and to be introduced as his friend. The Colonel hesitated at
      first, as he feared he might possibly be recognized by some of his old
      Washington acquaintances, or by some of Baker's secret detectives. He
      finally consented, however, and, in the disguise of a "French exquisite,"
      did attend President Lincoln's grand reception, and saw and heard all that
      was to be seen and heard on such occasions. Of course, Lord Brewerton was
      the observed of all observers, and was recognized by all (save those who
      knew to the contrary) as a staunch friend to the Union. A few days after,
      Lord Brewerton and the Colonel went to Philadelphia, where they met a
      party of gentlemen at Dr. Charles Howell's, and where future business
      arrangements were talked over and agreed upon. From here the lord went to
      New York, while the Colonel returned to Washington and from thence to
      Richmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus we finish the record of the visit of one English peer to the Southern
      Confederacy; but this, by no means, constitutes the whole of such visits
      during the war. In January, 1863, Lord Talbot was at Charleston, having
      reached there by the way of Nassau. He had a son who was a colonel in the
      Confederate army, and who continued in the service until the close of the
      war. In November, 1863, Lords Harvey and Kartwright were at Richmond;
      they, too, having reached the Confederate States by the way of Nassau.
      Major Hodges, one of General Beauregard's staff, was the son of an English
      lord, and did faithful service until the war closed. Adjutant-General
      Cooper said that upon the army rolls were the names of scores who were
      either the sons of, or nearly related to, English peers. Lord Cavendish,
      who was in very bad health, remained at Nassau during most of the time
      that the war continued, rendering such aid to the Confederacy as lay in
      his power. Indeed, the immense hotel at Nassau was crowded with English
      and Northern sympathizers with the South nearly all the while, from the
      beginning to the end of the war, watching chances for running the
      blockade, and otherwise aiding the Confederacy in whatever way they could.
      These gentlemen, however, while friends to the Confederacy, were still
      more friends to their own pockets. With them "cotton was king," and of
      this king they were trying to get as much in their pockets as possible,
      while English ministers and English consuls were aiding them to the extent
      of their ability. This was true not only at Washington and at Nassau, but
      generally with British ministers and British consuls throughout the world,
      which fact, added to what we have related of Lord Brewerton, who,
      doubtless, represented many other persons besides himself, and many other
      interests besides his own, fully justifies, as we think, the caption given
      to this chapter, Nobility after the Nuggets&mdash;Diplomacy Prompting the
      Actors.

      CHAPTER VI. IN TIGHT PLACES AND OUT. SHREWDNESS PULLING THE WIRES.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE plan of our
      work admits of only one more chapter on the subject of running the land
      blockade, though, if space permitted, the entire volume might be filled
      with incidents connected with this one service. This chapter, therefore,
      must embrace a variety of incidents.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one of the trips, Colonel Abercrombie conducted Mr. Charles R.
      Dangerfield from Washington to Richmond, and return. Mr. Dangerfield was a
      large manufacturer, or the agent of manufacturers, of English arms,
      accoutrements, etc., and his object in visiting Richmond was to make
      contracts with the Confederacy in exchange for cotton. Nothing of special
      note occurred on the way to Richmond, except that, while lying at the
      negro hut all day, two men came to the door, and asked "Aunt Jemima" if
      Colonel Abercrombie was not there? This Mr. Dangerfield heard, and it
      frightened him almost out of his wits. "Now Grant's men have us!" said he,
      and, springing up from where he lay, he was ready to surrender at once;
      but the military experience of the Colonel made him cooler and more
      courageous than the Englishman, and he, instead of surrendering, was
      getting ready to sell his life as dearly as possible, when "Aunt Jemima"
      called out, "All's right, honey, all's right! dese be your guides, Mas'er
      Colonel; all's right!" Had a ten-thousand ton weight been lifted from Mr.
      Dangerfield's breast, he could not have felt more relieved. He was ready
      to dance a hornpipe then and there, and would have done it, had he not
      been too old, fat, and clumsy for such a youthful sport. From Richmond,
      Mr. Dangerfield visited all the larger cities, and all the cotton-storing
      places of the Confederacy. On his return to Richmond he made contracts
      with the government to his entire satisfaction, and in due time returned
      to Washington, New York, and thence to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      At another time the Colonel conducted another English manufacturer, Mr.
      Francis Willis, across the lines and back. He, like Mr. Dangerfield,
      visited the principal points in the Confederacy, and, on his return to
      Richmond, made contracts to furnish arms, accoutrements, saddles,
      clothing, etc., in exchange for cotton.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were others who were passengers on this line, at various times; but
      as their object was to see friends or attend to domestic affairs, and had
      no direct connection with the war, we think it unnecessary to
      particularize them.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one of the trips Colonel Abercrombie was arrested as a spy&mdash;though
      his duties, and those of Colonel Killgore's, were as foreign to those of a
      spy as one thing can be foreign to another&mdash;and as there were
      incidents connected with the arrest and escape never heretofore known, we
      will now relate them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel was on his way from Richmond to Washington. Had reached Great
      Falls in safety, and was about half way between that point and Georgetown,
      when a sentinel suddenly called, "Halt! stand, or I'll fire." The Colonel,
      who was in the disguise of a farmer, tried to explain to the sentinel that
      he was a farmer, living near Georgetown; that he had been up to Garrett
      &amp; Morse's store to see a friend, and was now on his way back; that he
      was an uncompromising "<i>Union</i> man," etc., etc.; but the sentinel's
      only reply was that his orders were to halt and detain any one who
      attempted to pass his post, and that the Colonel must stand precisely
      where halted until the corporal came around, and not move a step forward
      or backward, or he would fire upon him. The Colonel saw that he had a
      sentinel to deal with who could not be either cajoled or bribed, and that
      he could do nothing else than await the coming of the corporal, and then
      try his arts upon him. Could he have got near the sentinel, he would have
      disarmed him and escaped, but this was impossible. When the corporal came
      around to relieve the guard the Colonel told him the same story he had
      told the sentinel; but he seemed to doubt the story, and told the Colonel
      he must "fall in" and accompany them to the Captain's headquarters, about
      a half-mile distant. On reaching there the Colonel repeated the same old
      story, to all of which the Captain listened attentively and respectfully.
      The Captain had just eaten his supper, and, learning from the Colonel that
      he had not yet had his, asked him to take a seat at the table and help
      himself. While the Colonel was eating, the Captain narrowly observed him,
      and pretty soon cried out, "Yes! I see you are a farmer from the way you
      handle your knife and fork! A pretty farmer you are, to be sure!" The
      Colonel was nonplussed for a moment and could make no reply; but after
      awhile managed to say that he "could n't see why a farmer could not handle
      a knife and fork just as well as anybody else." He was caught, fairly
      caught, by his "society manners," and the more he talked, the better
      satisfied the Captain became that he was not a farmer, and might be a spy.
      He was accordingly sent, that same night, to the headquarters of the
      Eleventh Pennsylvania regiment, and there put in the guard-house. Next
      morning the colonel of this regiment sent him to General Wilson's
      headquarters, near by, who, after some questions, sent him back to the
      guard-house. The next night Colonel Abercrombie made an attempt to escape,
      and nearly succeeded. This being reported to General Wilson, he ordered a
      heavy ball and chain to be strongly riveted to the Colonel's leg. Matters
      now began to look desperate; for, while the Colonel had no fear of being
      condemned as a spy, he was ready to do anything, rather than be brought
      before a court-martial and <i>recognized</i>. He bethought himself of some
      medicine he always carried with him. Of this he took a dose, and soon had
      a most violent diarrhoea. He now could ask, and did ask, to be sent to a
      hospital, and next day was sent to the Lincoln Hospital, near Georgetown.
      It changed that on the next couch to his in the hospital lay a Confederate
      captain, named Lawrence Norton, of Georgia. The two soon became
      acquainted. The Colonel told the Captain that if by any means the ball and
      chain could be taken from his leg, he could escape from the hospital. The
      Captain told his wife this when she visited him next day; the wife became
      immediately interested, and soon procured and brought to her husband a
      watch-spring file; the Captain that same night so filed the clasp, which
      held the ball and chain to the Colonel's ankle, that it could be slipped
      off at any moment. The Colonel watched the surgeon when he came into the
      hospital next day, and managed to slip a pass from the surgeon's overcoat
      pocket while it lay upon a stand near his bed. With this pass and two
      empty bottles in his hand, he rushed by the sentinel at the door, on the
      plea that he was in great haste to bring medicines which the doctor had
      just sent him after. Once outside the building, he sprang over a cemetery
      fence, and from thenceforth allowed no grass to grow under his feet until
      he was safe at Ben Beveridge's hotel. Here, of course, there was great
      rejoicing at the Colonel's wonderful escape; but, fearing pursuit, it was
      thought best that the Colonel should proceed at once to Baltimore, and
      from thence to Philadelphia. It was deemed best, too, that he should not
      start from the Washington depot, lest detectives be on the watch there for
      him. Accordingly, Ben ordered up his own spanking team of bays, and before
      daybreak had the Colonel at the Bladensburg station, where he took the
      first train that came along for Baltimore. Fearing, however, to go into
      the Baltimore depot, lest detectives might be there on the watch for him,
      the Colonel got off the train at the Relay House, and gave a man a
      twenty-dollar gold piece to drive him into Baltimore, a distance of about
      thirteen miles. He went direct to the Fountain Hotel, in Light Street,
      where he remained carefully concealed for several days, only seeing Mr.
      Thomas, Mr. Wilson, and such others as he knew to be firm friends of the
      Southern cause. Then he went to Philadelphia and remained at Dr. Howell's
      for about two weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the newspapers of Washington and of the whole country were
      publishing accounts about the "wonderful escape of a rebel spy," and all
      sorts of guesses were made as to who he was, how he had managed to escape,
      who had helped him, where he had gone, etc., etc. Of course, the whole of
      Baker's national detective force and all the police and detective forces
      of New York, Philadelphia, and of every other Northern city, were
      specially charged to search out, arrest, and bring to speedy justice this
      "desperate rebel spy;" but not one of them all ever succeeded in
      arresting, nor even in ascertaining who this "rebel spy" was; and not
      until this shall appear in print will the world at large ever know who the
      arrested party was, how he managed his escape, or what became of him after
      his escape.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. JOHNSON IN A QUANDARY. THE HEART MASTERING THE HEAD.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here was another
      incident connected with the running of the land blockade which, though
      hardly sufficient for an entire chapter, is too important and too
      interesting to allow to pass without notice: for not until this is
      published will it ever be known outside of some half-dozen persons. The
      incident was as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      On one of his blockade-running visits to Washington, Colonel Abercrombie
      learned that Senator Andrew Johnson, as it then was (though afterwards
      Vice-President, and still afterwards President of the United States), had
      rooms at Beveridge's Hotel, the very place that he was making his
      headquarters when in Washington. Knowing the Senator to be a fierce,
      uncompromising Union man, the news of his close proximity at first alarmed
      the Colonel; but, upon reflection, he remembered that Mrs. Johnson and his
      mother had long been on the most intimate terms,&mdash;that the Senator
      knew him personally, and had always treated him with the utmost kindness,&mdash;that
      he was a man of generous heart, and even though he should learn of his
      being there, the danger of his interfering with him was next to nothing.
      He therefore decided to stand his ground and take the chances.
    </p>
    <p>
      As proximity to danger is always exciting, and, after a time, becomes
      attractive, so in this case, what at first seemed alarming, after a time
      became so attractive that the Colonel had a longing desire to see and
      converse with his old friend, Andrew Johnson. He communicated this desire
      to his friend and co-associate in the blockade-running business, Ben
      Beveridge, and asked him what he thought of it. Ben, at first, thought it
      would not do at all; but, like the Colonel, after thinking over the matter
      some time, concluded that it would be a capital joke, and advised the
      Colonel to try it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel was disguised&mdash;so disguised, indeed, that even his own
      sister would not have known him, had she met him in the street&mdash;and
      the arrangement was, that Ben should await in the entry, near the
      Senator's chamber-door, while the Colonel went in to talk with him; and
      that, if the Senator did not receive him kindly, or if he showed any
      disposition to arrest him, the Colonel should at once quit the room, and
      Ben would help him to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything thus understood, the Colonel went to the Senator's door and
      knocked gently. A deep, stentorian voice replied, "Come in but the Colonel
      pretended not to hear this, and knocked again, as he wanted the Senator to
      come to and open the door, that he might at once step within the room,
      whether the Senator invited him to do so or not. The second knock brought
      the Senator to the door, which he opened far enough to face his visitor,
      when he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you do, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel replied, and, while replying, stepped within the room, when
      the Senator shut the door, and invited his visitor to take a seat. The
      Colonel did not sit down, but, taking hold of the back of the chair
      offered him, he said to Mr. Johnson:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem not to know me, Mr. Senator. When did you leave Greenville? and
      where is Mrs. Johnson and Bob?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This confused the Senator more than ever, as the visitor seemed to be
      familiar with his wife and son, as well as with himself, and yet he could
      not recollect to have ever seen him before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, no," replied the Senator, "I really cannot place you, or call your
      name. By jingo! who are you, any way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess you don't want to know me," replied the Colonel, "and I had
      better be going."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, sir; oh, no," replied Mr. Johnson; "sit down! sit down! When did
      you come from Greenville? But really, sir, I cannot recall your name&mdash;I
      cannot."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel observed the Senator's confusion, and so enjoyed the joke that
      it was some time before he would let himself be known. Then, suddenly
      tearing the false whiskers from his face and putting on a natural
      expression, he stood revealed before the Senator.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My God! is this you, Ralph?" was all that Mr. Johnson could say for some
      moments; and then added, "Why, Ralph, ain't you in the rebel service?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what if I am?" replied the Colonel; "you don't propose to arrest
      me, do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no; but, by jingo! what under heavens brought you here?" said the
      Senator; and, going to the door, locked it before the Colonel had time to
      reply. "Sit down! sit down!" he added, "and tell me all about it. What
      under heavens could have brought you here, or induced you to call upon
      me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel then took a seat and explained to Mr. Johnson why he was
      there, the nature of his business, and that he had only called upon him as
      a good joke, and to renew an old acquaintance; to all of which the Senator
      listened attentively, though trembling meanwhile from excitement. When the
      Colonel had finished, Mr. Johnson sprang from his chair, walked hurriedly
      across the room two or three times, went to the front windows and pulled
      down the shades, and then, turning to the Colonel, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does anybody know that you are here with me?" Just then Mr. Johnson heard
      a tittering in the entryway, and, turning to the Colonel, asked him if he
      had any companions waiting outside. The Colonel replied, that he thought
      it might be Ben, as he alone knew of his visit. Immediately Mr. Johnson
      stepped to the door, and, seeing Ben, asked him to step in. Ben did so,
      and now the Senator became more in a quandary than ever. He scolded both
      Ben and the Colonel pretty severely, and told them they did not appreciate
      the awkward position in which they were placing him; that, if the
      Colonel's visit to him were known, it would, under the circumstances,
      compromise him in a most serious manner. Ben tried to soothe the Senator
      by telling him that the Colonel's call upon him was only intended as a
      joke; that it could never be known outside of their three selves; and that
      it should never be repeated, if annoying to him. The Senator replied, that
      while he was glad, personally, to see Ralph, yet the fact that he was
      known to be an officer in the rebel army, and in his business of
      blockade-running might by some be regarded as a spy, made it doubly
      awkward for him, and, if it were known to the Senate, might cost him his
      seat, as well as his reputation as a consistent Union man; that nearly
      every one would say that he ought to have had the Colonel arrested and
      detained, at least as a prisoner-of-war, if not as a spy; and that, in
      holding communication with him without attempting his arrest, he made
      himself a party to his crime, whether as a rebel to the government or as a
      spy. The more the Senator talked about it, the graver he became over it,
      until the Colonel and Ben saw that what had been intended as a comedy
      might prove a serious tragedy with all concerned, and that the sooner they
      got out of the way the better. Before leaving, the Senator exacted from
      each a solemn promise that they would not repeat the joke under any
      possible circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no kind of doubt that Senator Johnson felt greatly troubled at
      receiving such a visit from an officer in the Confederate service, and in
      learning that his landlady's son, Ben, was just as much of a rebel at
      heart as the Colonel himself. He knew, too, that his official duty as a
      United States Senator was to have both of these men arrested, tried, and,
      if possible, convicted, while his heart prompted to a course directly the
      contrary. He had long known, and had high regard for, the mothers of both;
      the men he had known from childhood upward, and always liked them, as
      boys, as young men, as men in active life, and he would as soon have
      thought of having his own son, "Bob," arrested as either of these, and yet
      his duty plainly pointed in that direction. It was a conflict between his
      head and his heart, in which his heart gained the mastery.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the Senator did not hold any ill-will against the Colonel or against
      Ben for this wild prank of theirs against his Senatorial and official
      dignity is proven from the fact that he still continued to board with
      Ben's mother at the "Washington House," and within two years after he
      became President he appointed the Colonel as one of three commissioners to
      reopen and establish mail-routes throughout the late Confederate States.

      CHAPTER VII. PRISONERS, HOW USED AND HOW ABUSED. CRAFT AND CRUELTY
    </h2>
    <h3>
      PROMPTING THE ACTORS.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N General L. C.
      Baker's "History of the United States Secret Service," four chapters are
      devoted to the subject of bounty-jumpers. In these chapters the startling
      facts are disclosed that on investigation, it was found that only one in
      four of the enlisted men reached the front that, in some instances, the
      entire quota of a township was filled with the names of bounty-jumpers,
      not one of whom ever really enlisted or went to the front; that desertions
      from the army became so common that to "even attempt to show, by actual
      figures, the number would be impossible;" that "to aid the soldier to
      desert was deemed to be as much the legitimate business and calling of the
      professional bounty broker as to enlist him;" that in one investigation it
      was shown, "out of 5,284 enlisted, only 2,083 actually entered the
      service;" that out of this number&mdash;less than one-half who really
      enlisted&mdash;not more than three-fourths ever reached the front, and of
      these probably one-fourth deserted and returned to the States, to reënlist
      and receive bounty again; that of one hundred and "eighty-three who
      enlisted in one day at Hoboken and were credited to the quota of Jersey
      City, every one was a bounty-jumper;" that case after case came to light
      where a single bounty-jumper had enlisted <i>three</i> times, and received
      three separate bounties, in <i>one</i> day, and that even gipsy-like gangs
      were organized, who travelled from city to city, enlisting such of their
      number as they could, assisting such as enlisted to escape, and then on to
      the next city or recruiting station to repeat the same thing. Of one such
      gang it is related that "in a trip of thirty-two days their total profits
      amounted to $32,000."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also a matter of record that while skirmishes and battles were in
      progress, Union soldiers in the front ranks, and especially if sent
      forward as skirmishers, would sometimes throw down their muskets and run
      over to the enemy; and it not unfrequently happened that sentinels on the
      outposts were missing and never heard of more, or, if heard of, it would
      be found they had gone within the Confederate lines and surrendered.
    </p>
    <p>
      These matters have all been told, and well told, by other historians, but
      not until these "Secrets of the Rebellion" have been published will it be
      generally known what became of those who thus threw down their arms, and
      of those who thus abandoned their posts, to go over to the enemy, and that
      to encourage bounty-jumping in the North, and thereby promote desertions
      from the Union army, became, after August, 1863, a part of the masterly
      diplomacy or tactics adopted by the Confederate Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the bounty-jumpers who first tried the game of going over to the enemy,
      under the belief that they would soon be exchanged or paroled, and thus
      have opportunities for procuring additional bounties, quite a number were
      shot as spies. The "dead-board," as it was called, of General Lee's army,
      had a summary way of dealing with all cases which they deemed of a
      questionable character. A statement from the person making the arrest;
      where found, and under what circumstances; a few questions to the accused;
      a consultation of ten minutes among the seven officers who composed the
      board; sentence; and on the day following, and sometimes on the same day,
      the accused would be seen sitting on an empty coffin, on his way to
      execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in August, 1863, a new thought crossed the brain of the Confederate
      authorities. They then concluded that, instead of shooting bounty-jumpers
      as spies, they could make them serviceable to the Confederate cause by
      using them as stool-pigeons, and like as stool-pigeons are used to draw
      whole flocks into the net, so these could be used to corrupt, and bring
      thousands into the Confederate lines. In pursuance of this new idea, five
      large tobacco warehouses, on Carey Street, each three stories high,
      directly opposite "Castle Thunder," in Richmond, were converted into a
      prison, and called "Castle Lightning." In this prison, bounty-jumpers
      alone were put, and the rations furnished them were doubly as good as the
      rations furnished the prisoners in other prisons. Whenever an exchange of
      prisoners was possible, those in Castle Lightning were always given the
      preference, and, when about to leave, they were told that they should take
      from the Yankees as many bounties as they possibly could; that, if again
      sent to the front, they should desert, and bring as many others along with
      them as possible; that they would always be well treated, and given the
      best rations the Confederacy could afford; that they would be exchanged,
      or otherwise sent back to their homes, at the first opportunity; and that
      to secure safety and good treatment, when coming into the Confederate
      lines, they should cry out, "Bounty-jumper! Bounty-jumper!" This was told
      them not only when about to leave, but again, and again, and again during
      their stay, and the superior treatment they received while prisoners,
      assured them that the promises made would all be fulfilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a few weeks after the return of the first batch of these
      bounty-jumpers to the North, the effect of the new policy began to show
      itself, and it steadily increased from that time onward. Hardly a day, and
      sometimes several times in a day, squads of Union prisoners arrived in
      Richmond, and were marched to Castle Lightning, who had voluntarily come
      within the lines, and claimed to be bounty-jumpers. Nor was there scarcely
      a day in which squads of these same men might not be seen leaving the
      prison, on their way to be exchanged, or otherwise sent back to the Union
      army, or direct to their homes. Like leaven, its tendency was to leaven
      the whole lump, as the authorities of the Confederacy believed would be
      the case when they adopted the policy. One such man in a company would, in
      time, taint the whole company; ten such men in a regiment would, in time,
      taint the whole regiment. When a battle is progressing, a single regiment,
      yea, a single company, going over to the enemy will sometimes so change
      the tide of battle that what seemed an assured victory, will prove a most
      disastrous defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course it is not known, never can be known, how many millions of
      dollars, nor how many thousands of lives the adoption of this policy by
      the South cost the North; nor can the South ever know the amount of
      advantage which they derived from adopting the policy; but that it was a
      new mode of warfare, and showed great shrewdness on the part of those who
      conceived and carried out the project, all will agree in admitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus shown how the Confederate authorities used Union prisoners to
      benefit their own cause, we will next proceed to state some additional
      facts as to the abuse received by other Union prisoners. The facts which
      we now purpose to state are not from hearsay, not from one-sided
      newspapers, nor from partisan historians, but directly from the lips of
      one who had occasion to visit Confederate prisoners frequently during the
      war, whose whole soul was in, and with, the Confederate cause, and who
      could not be, and would not be, by any who knew him, accused of sympathy
      with the "Yankees," as he usually styles Union soldiers when speaking of
      them. We have not space to write of all, and will limit our remarks to
      only four of the many places throughout the Confederate States at which
      Union prisoners were confined.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>First</i>.&mdash;"Libby Prison." This was located in Richmond, and had
      been a tobacco warehouse previous to its use as a prison. It was an
      immense brick building, three stories high, rough floors, no plastering, a
      great number of windows, no fire-places, and no means for heating other
      than for the office on the first floor. In this, hundreds of Union
      prisoners were thrust and kept for weeks, months, years&mdash;some with
      scarcely enough clothing left to cover their nakedness, and with no chance
      for a change; many without a blanket, even in the coldest winter weather;
      all without beds, or mattress, or anything but the hard floor to lie upon.
      Their ordinary daily ration consisted of a loaf made from one pint of
      corn-meal and one pint of rice soup. Occasionally, though rarely, they
      would have bread made from wheat flour and soup made from meat and bones.
      Once in a great while they were served with meat, but the quantity served
      to each man was so small that it could be taken at a mouthful. Our
      informant says he knows of a certainty that some <i>actually starved to
      death</i>&mdash;that others <i>actually froze to death</i>&mdash;that many
      were <i>wantonly shot</i> while thoughtlessly looking out of the windows,
      by sentinels on the sidewalks, who had positive orders from Lieutenant
      Turner, the officer in command of Libby, to shoot any "d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d
      Yankee" whose head might be seen at the window-bars; and that hundreds,
      yea, thousands, died from sickness brought upon them by the privations
      from which they suffered. We could give other details, but they are too
      horrible to write, and would be too sickening to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Second</i>.&mdash;"Castle Thunder." All that we have said of "Libby"
      will apply equally well to this prison, except that in some cases the
      cruelty of treatment might be <i>multiplied by two</i>, and in some
      instances by <i>three.</i> Here our informant saw prisoners with ball and
      chain to their legs, and handcuffed together; chanced to be in the room
      when the brains of one of the prisoners were spattered against the wall,
      by a ball from the musket in the hands of a sentinel on the pavement two
      stories below, and only because the prisoner had dared to look out at a
      window; learned of many like cases which occurred before and after that
      visit; nor has he any doubt that scores were there inhumanly shot, because
      of orders from the officer in command, Captain Alexander. At least one
      Union prisoner, a Captain Dayton, was hung on the charge of being a spy.
      In this prison, dogs that chanced to stray in were seized, killed, and
      eaten; and rat-meat was regarded as a dainty dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Third</i>.&mdash;Salisbury, N. C., was a large enclosure within a high
      board fence, on the outside of which was a walk for sentinels, and within
      which was the "dead-line," about thirty feet from the fence, to cross
      which meant instant death to any prisoner. The "sinks" for the camp were
      located on this "dead-line," and at one of his visits our informant saw
      the dead body of a prisoner lying in one of the "sinks," who had been shot
      by a sentinel in the afternoon of the day before while sitting on the pole
      at the "sink." The sentinel, when asked why he had shot the prisoner,
      replied that he thought he was trying to come over the dead-line and
      therefore shot him. At this same visit our informant saw sentinels, with
      guns on their shoulders, pacing their rounds on the outside of this fence,
      who were not over twelve years of age, and the one who had shot the
      prisoner at the "sink" was scarcely over this age. The whole regiment on
      guard at that camp, at that time, was made up of boys from twelve to
      sixteen years of age, and of very old men&mdash;not one of all of whom was
      fit for a soldier. The officer in command, a Major Gee, was himself a
      brute, and no more fit to have the care of human beings than a hyena would
      be to be placed in charge of a sheepfold. Here, as at Libby and Castle
      Thunder, the usual ration was a loaf made from one pint of corn-meal, each
      day, and occasionally a small bit of meat. For shelter most of them had to
      burrow for themselves, like rabbits, in holes under ground; and so poorly
      were they off for clothing and shoes, that our informant saw scores of men
      standing about the doors of hospitals, waiting for the clothing and shoes
      of those who might die within. Every morning carts came around to gather
      up the dead, to take them without the camp and throw in trenches.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Fourth</i>.&mdash;Andersonville, Georgia. This was an enclosure of
      about twenty-five acres, surrounded by a high stockade, and by earthworks
      mounted with cannon. One end of the enclosure was a swamp, through which
      crept a sluggish, muddy stream, and this was the only water to which the
      prisoners had access. To add to the filthiness and consequent
      unhealthfulness of this water, a Confederate camp was located upon it,
      above the point where the stream entered the stockade. The few buildings
      within the enclosure were scarcely enough for hospital purposes, and here,
      as at Salisbury, the prisoners had to burrow in the earth for shelter.
      Even in the coldest of weather thousands had no blankets, nor scarcely
      clothing enough to cover their nakedness. Their ordinary ration here, as
      at the other places named, was a loaf made from one pint of corn-meal each
      day, and when, as occasionally they did, receive anything beyond this, it
      was regarded as a rare treat. The shooting of men on the "dead-line" was
      almost of daily occurrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, many of the prisoners became so crazed from suffering that they
      sought death in this way. General Winder was commander of the camp, and
      under him was the Captain Wirz who was tried, convicted, and hung at
      Washington near the close of the war. Thousands at the South, as well as
      at the North, believed then, and believe still, that General Winder,
      instead of his subordinate officer, should have stood beneath the
      hangman's noose. Undoubtedly he could have corrected these terrible wrongs
      had he tried. That he did not try is proof positive that he did not care.
      The world at large always gives to commanders the chief credit of all done
      by their subordinates, and, on the same principle, holds them responsible
      for all that their subordinates fail to do or do wrongfully. Had General
      Winder desired his prisoners to have had better treatment, neither Captain
      Wirz, nor any other of his subordinates, would have treated them as they
      did. How much they suffered none will ever know. The horrible things
      related in the foregoing pages, and the thousands of other terrible things
      related by others who have written the history of the Rebellion, are but
      as drops to the ocean, as sands to the sea-shore, to all that occurred
      during the war. Dark deeds seek to hide themselves always, and while the
      "secrets" of this volume, and a few-others, have oozed out since the war,
      others doubtless quite as bad have never yet, and probably never will, see
      the light of day. And possibly it is best so. There are some deeds that so
      harrow up one's feelings that, if related, they would, as said by Hamlet's
      ghost:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      "Freeze the young blood;

    <p class="indent15">
      The knotted and combined locks to part,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And each particular hair to stand on end
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Like quills upon the fretful porcupine."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, after hearing them, make us to cry out with Hamlet (slightly varied)
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
    </p>

      And shall I couple hell? O fie! Hold, hold my heart;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      We could ourself add more, much more, from what our informant told us; but
      our heart sickens over such recitals, and our readers, we are sure, have
      had quite enough of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first question, and the most natural question for any one to ask,
      after reading the terrible atrocities just recited, would be, Who was or
      is accountable for all this suffering?
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman from whose lips we gathered most of the foregoing facts had
      opportunities of learning the individual sentiments of President Davis
      upon this subject, as upon many others, quite as well, perhaps, as any man
      within the lines of the Confederacy, and he assured us that Mr. Davis
      regretted, as much as any man could regret, the sufferings of Union
      prisoners, and that, whenever reports of their ill-treatment came to his
      ears, he at once gave them attention. That, time and again, Mr. Davis
      appointed gentlemen of high character to visit the prison-places we have
      named, and report to him any and all abuses of which they might learn;
      that, again and again, he cautioned, reprimanded, and in some cases re
      moved, officers charged with cruelty to Union prisoners; and that he did
      whatever it was possible for him to do to mitigate their sufferings. In
      view of the high personal character which Mr. Davis bore before he became
      President of the Confederacy, and, of the consistent Christian character
      he has since borne, it is to be hoped that this is a correct
      interpretation of his sentiments with reference to Union prisoners. It
      would almost make one lose faith in humanity were it otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      If President Davis was not responsible, the next most natural question
      would be, Who is? and to this answers would differ with almost every one
      who might attempt to make reply. While the outrages were being
      perpetrated, the people of the North generally held Mr. Davis responsible
      for all of them, on the principle heretofore stated; but towards the close
      of the war, and during the ten years following the war, public opinion
      greatly changed, until few, if any, held him longer responsible; and now
      there are not probably ten men in the whole United States, of such as know
      anything of the facts, who hold him personally responsible for these
      outrages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our informant thought the responsibility lay most, if not wholly, with the
      officers in immediate command of these prisons and camps. That, while food
      was undoubtedly scarce in the Confederacy, still he believed the prisoners
      did not get all that the government allowed and paid for; that while
      charged only with the safe-keeping of the prisoners, the officers in
      command went far beyond this, and made security a pretext for severity;
      that they were malicious, vindictive, devilish, and, while dressed in a
      "little brief authority," allowed these traits of their own characters to
      have full play in torturing those committed to their keeping. If this, or
      half of this, be true, God have pity on their souls when they stand, as
      all must, before Christ's judgment-seat!

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE remark is
      attributed to General Grant that he had "less dread of the whole of
      General Lee's army than of Colonel Moseby's cavalry." To one unacquainted
      with the irregular, predatory mode of warfare of these bands, such a
      remark, from such a source, would seem impossible; but when it is known
      that cunning, deception, downright lying, and any amount of cruelty needed
      to their ends, were principles and practices which they regarded as fair;
      that they did not hold themselves amenable to army regulations, nor to the
      law of nations, but were in all cases a "law unto themselves," then the
      wonder ceases, and we can understand that even so fearless and so wise a
      general as Grant might have made just such a remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the war the newspapers of the whole country had considerable to say
      about Moseby and his marauding band; and, since the war, all who have
      written histories have had more or less to say about him; and yet not the
      one-hundredth part of his depredations have ever been recorded, nor is
      there one in a thousand, either North or South, who know how his band was
      organized, how they operated, or what were the results, except in a few
      cases, of their operations. With our army experience of nearly three
      years, and with all our reading of newspapers and histories, we admit to
      have known nothing, or next to nothing, of the plan on which his band was
      organized, of the principles on which they operated, and of the terrible
      results of those operations until quite recently. It chanced, not long
      since, that we met a gentleman who was an officer in the Confederate army
      during nearly the whole of the war, who was personally acquainted with
      Colonel Moseby and many of his men, and who had from their own lips
      carefully detailed accounts of many of their daring exploits, at a time
      when they gloried in them and delighted to tell them to their friends; and
      whose personal relations with President Davis, Adjutant-General Cooper,
      and others gave him the opportunity of knowing what was going on <i>behind</i>
      the scenes, as well as upon the stage. From him we gathered most of the
      following facts, and as many of them have never been published before, we
      are sure they will be of great interest, as showing another phase of the
      acts going on behind the scenes while the armies of the Union and of the
      Confederacy were fighting their battles on the public stage, with all the
      world as spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be recollected that in the beginning of the Confederate government
      troops were called out by proclamation of the President, the same as at
      the North. But that, after a time, as the war progressed and volunteering
      became less and less, conscription had to be resorted to, and, finally,
      that every man at all able to bear arms was called into the service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the war Colonel Moseby proposed to the Confederate War Department
      to raise a company for "special and <i>independent</i> service," meaning
      guerilla service, though of course he did not use a word so objectionable
      in making the application. He was then a practising lawyer in a small town
      in Western Virginia, and wanted to keep up his own dignity as well as that
      of his profession. The War Department granted his request, and in a little
      while his company was full. Finding others eager to join him, as the young
      men of his own and of adjoining counties much preferred to join an
      "independent" command than go into the Confederate army (and they soon
      found they must do one or the other), he next proposed to the War
      Department to raise a regiment on the same basis. This, too, was granted
      him, and in due time he had about fifteen hundred men on his muster-rolls,
      divided up into companies, each with its captain, lieutenants, sergeants,
      etc., many of whom were not known to the general public, nor scarcely
      beyond their immediate friends and relatives. All his officers and all his
      men lived at their homes, on their farms, in their offices, in their
      stores, in their workshops, pursuing their usual vocations; but each was
      careful to carry, concealed about his person, a certificate showing that
      he belonged to Colonel Moseby's regiment of "independent" cavalry, so that
      if called upon by a conscripting officer he could at once show that he was
      already in the service. The regiment was called "independent," and was
      really so, for the reason that it was attached to no brigade, division, or
      corps, but operated and cooperated with other commands only as chance
      happened to throw them together. His orders came from the President, or
      the War Department, through Adjutant-General Cooper, who directed him whom
      to obey as his superior officer for the time being, and to whom to report
      at any time for special duty. Many, a great many, of his acts, however,
      were done purely on his own volition, on his own responsibility, and
      without orders from any superior officer, nor were these acts always
      approved by those at the seat of government. Two or three times he was
      summoned to Richmond to answer complaints lodged against him; but such was
      the influence he exerted with members of the Confederate Congress, through
      members of his regiment, many of whom were the sons or near relatives of
      some of the most wealthy and most influential families of Virginia, that
      each time he came off scot-free, and was worse after than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      His ordinary manner of operating was as follows: His officers and men, as
      before stated, lived at home, and were only known as citizens, pursuing
      their ordinary vocations; and, for the last two years of the war, a
      considerable number, probably more than half, lived <i>within</i> the
      Union lines, and called themselves "Union" men. From and after the time
      when the Rapidan River became the line of the two armies this was
      especially so; and after that time nearly all his operations lay between
      the Rapidan and the Potomac, mostly in the counties of Loudon, Fauquier,
      Shenandoah, and Rockingham. Occasionally he would cross the Potomac into
      Maryland, and operate at points between Cumberland City and the Great
      Falls.
    </p>
    <p>
      When from officers and members of his own regiment living within the Union
      lines, or from others, he would learn of the contemplated movements of
      certain supply-trains, of certain paymasters, of certain small squads on
      special duty, he would at once issue orders to enough of his men to meet
      him at a particular house, or a particular cross-roads, at ten or twelve
      o'clock of a particular night, fully armed, equipped, and mounted for the
      service in which they were about to engage. Sometimes the number ordered
      out would be ten, sometimes twenty, sometimes fifty, and sometimes a whole
      company or more, according to the force which they expected to meet and
      overcome. Only when ordered to join and cooperate with some general
      commanding officer, would he call out his whole available force. He had no
      fixed headquarters, but his officers and men always knew exactly where to
      communicate with him, as he always knew exactly where to find them; and
      when he issued an order it was speedily conveyed from lip to lip, and
      seldom failed to meet with the expected response. He and his men were all
      the while on the alert, and seldom failed to take prompt advantage of any
      opportunity that offered. His own men not unfrequently applied for (as
      farmers' sons living in the neighborhood) and obtained temporary
      employment as team-drivers, blacksmiths, farriers, etc., in the Union
      army, and in this way secured information in advance of every contemplated
      movement, whether of the army, of supplies, or of detachments on special
      service. As soon as such information was obtained, it was conveyed from
      lip to lip, until it reached the ears of Colonel Moseby. Then he would
      decide whether a raid was practicable or not; and if it was, the needed
      number of men were summoned to meet him at a certain place at a set time.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get through the line of Union sentinels without alarming the whole
      Union army, he had numerous stratagems. Having men on both sides of the
      line, he knew the exact location of every post, just the hour at which
      each sentinel was placed and relieved, and the precise strength of the
      squad or company, and where located, from which each sentinel was
      detached. Where only a single sentinel needed to be removed, to allow him
      and his squad to pass in and out of the Union lines, he was stealthily
      pounced upon, disarmed, killed, or otherwise taken care of. If more than
      one needed removing, the same operation might be practised on two or more.
      Where a whole squad or company needed to be gobbled up, he had enough of
      his men to quietly surround them, and, at the blowing of a whistle or
      other signal, suddenly pounce upon and take them all prisoners, usually
      without the firing of a gun, or with scarcely a word spoken above a
      whisper. Secrecy, celerity, and "dead men tell no tales," were his maxims&mdash;and
      most fearfully did he put these maxims into practice. It would fill this
      entire volume to tell all the times; but the following instances, selected
      from the many, some of which have and some of which <i>never have been
      told before</i>, will fully corroborate all that we have heretofore said,
      and show the terrible character of the warfare carried on by this class of
      men <i>behind</i> the scenes, while the Union and Confederate armies were
      contending for the mastery in front of the scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the summer and fall of 1863, Moseby's guerillas were exceedingly
      active. Almost every night they had some enterprise on hand, large or
      small, and while most of them were of such a character as to excite but
      little attention and no alarm, yet now and then one would occur of so
      startling a nature, and of so villanous a character, as to arouse all who
      heard of it, and make every honest man wish that the perpetrators could be
      caught and hung higher than Haman. The first we purpose to relate was of
      this character, and, so far as we know, this will be its first publication
      in historic form, though well known at the time by everybody in the
      neighborhood, and by officers in both armies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The position of Maryland during the war was exceedingly perplexing. Lying,
      as it does, midway between the North and the South, her soil was traversed
      by both armies, and her people were constantly subjected to annoyance, if
      not to danger, from both Union and Confederate troops. As a slaveholding
      State, the sympathies of her people were mostly with the Southern cause,
      and yet the business relations of many of her citizens with the people of
      the North, and her contiguity to Pennsylvania, had made many of her
      citizens strongly in favor of maintaining the Union. A considerable number
      of her citizens had joined the Confederate army; a considerable number had
      joined the Union army; while those who stayed at home endeavored to remain
      as nearly neutral as possible. To a Northern man or a Union soldier, they
      were all for the Union; to a Southern man or a Confederate soldier, they
      were all for Jefferson Davis and the Confederacy; to one who did not care
      a fig which side won, they were quite as indifferent as he dared be.
      Moseby and his midnight marauders seemed to have taken, for some cause, a
      special dislike to the Marylanders, and the first four instances we
      purpose to give occurred on that side of the Potomac.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. B. (our informant had forgotten the name, though he had been at the
      place and was entirely familiar with the incident, having obtained it from
      the lips of one who was a participant)&mdash;Mr. B. was a quiet,
      inoffensive old man, who endeavored to live at peace with everybody, and
      who was probably as little of a partisan as any man in the State. He
      seldom, if ever, talked upon politics, rarely about the war, and, when
      upon either, was always careful to do it in such a way as not to offend
      his listener. He kept a small country store at a point where two roads
      crossed each other, and was as ready to exchange his coffee, sugar, or
      molasses, his calicoes, hardware, or queensware, for country produce or
      for money, with a Confederate as with a Union man, or with a Union man as
      with a Confederate, There was no village about his store, not even the
      usual accompaniments of a blacksmith- and wheelwright-shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moseby had taken a dislike to this man. Why, it is not known, except it be
      that he sold his goods to Union men and Union soldiers, as well as to
      Confederates, when opportunity offered. So far as is known, the man had
      never given any personal offence to Moseby or his men, though they had
      several times visited his store, usually, if not always, in disguise; and
      we may here add, once for all, that when Moseby or his men were moving
      about within the Union lines on spying expeditions, they were always in
      disguise, and when they went to perpetrate a diabolical act, they always
      had their faces blackened, or were otherwise in mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a dark night, or rather about two o'clock in the morning, in August,
      1863, ten of Moseby's gang approached this store. One of the men was
      lifted up to, and crept in at, a window, and, going to the front door,
      unlocked and opened it, that some might enter while others remained on the
      outside as sentinels. Closing and locking the door, that there might be no
      escape of the inmates, they struck a light and then commenced a search for
      persons. They soon found the old man (the owner), two young men (his
      clerks or assistants), and a negro boy, all of whom had been asleep in the
      house adjoining, or in the second story of the store. As there were no
      women in the house, it is probable that he and his clerks had kept
      "bachelors' hall." Of course the proprietor, clerks, and negro boy were
      very much alarmed at seeing these men with blackened faces before them,
      and inquired what it all meant? They were quickly informed that it meant
      death to them, and a burning of the building, with all its contents: All
      commenced to plead for their lives, fell upon their knees, and besought
      their captors to spare their lives at least, whatever other punishment or
      destruction they might think proper to inflict; but the more they plead,
      the more deaf and the more lost to every sense of humanity their captors
      seemed to become. Taking some trace-chains which they found in the store,
      the old man, the two young men, and the negro boy were bound, hand and
      foot, and then secured to a post or some other fixed thing within the
      store. The only reason their captors would give for all this was that they
      were "d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d Yankees," that they had "supplied Union
      soldiers with food and clothing," that they were "traitors to the South,"
      etc., etc., etc., all of which was interspersed with most horrid oaths and
      curses. When all four had been securely bound, gagged, and fastened, and
      their captors had helped themselves to whatever they wanted of the
      articles in the store, they left the building, and in a few moments
      thereafter it was in flames. Had the bound captives within not been gagged
      they would have almost raised the dead with their cries; but, as it was,
      nothing was heard save the fierce crackling of the flames, and in a little
      while the building and its contents lay in ashes, mingled and intermingled
      with the bones of the four victims. Again Moseby's oft-repeated maxims had
      found a terrible illustration, "Dead men tell no tales"&mdash;"Dead men
      never bite!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The next instance of the doings of this gang of desperadoes which we
      purpose to relate, occurred not long after, near Shepherdstown, Md., and
      was of a much milder type of villany. We relate it here that our readers
      may see, by contrast, that these murdering guerillas were as ready to do
      small, mean things, as great, horrid things; and that personal malice and
      personal advantage, rather than advantage to the Southern Confederacy,
      were sometimes the incentives to their acts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant-Colonel Phillips, though a Marylander, was from the beginning
      of the agitation a strong Union man, and, when volunteers were called for
      from Maryland, did not hesitate a moment to offer his services in the
      Union cause, and became lieutenant-colonel of one of the Union Maryland
      regiments. He left at home, in care of his father, a very fine horse.
      Colonel Moseby heard of this horse, and determined to become its
      possessor. With blackened faces, he, or some of his men, went to the
      Phillips' farm at night, stole the horse, and returned to Virginia the
      same night. The fact soon after came to the ears of a chivalrous
      Confederate officer, who had known Lieutenant-Colonel Phillips when at the
      same college with himself, and who, though not liking Phillips now,
      disliked meanness still more. He informed General Breckinridge, and
      afterwards General Lee, of the theft. General Lee regarded such an act as
      a disgrace to the whole Confederate army, and at once sent a written order
      to Colonel Moseby to restore the horse. Colonel Moseby demurred, and tried
      to excuse the act as a legitimate capture from a well-known enemy; but
      General Lee was not to be deceived by any such sophistry, and insisted
      upon the return of the horse. The horse was returned!
    </p>
    <p>
      The next instance, which occurred near Williamsport, Md., not long after,
      was of a far blacker and more diabolical character. A farmer living near
      this place, and known as a "Dunkard," was believed to have considerable
      quantities of gold and silver laid away in pots and stocking-legs about
      his house. He was not only a "neutral" in politics and with regard to the
      war, but his religion made him a non-combatant as well. Confederates, of
      course, denounced him as a traitor to the Southern cause, and thought he
      should at least contribute his money, if not his life, to defend it. He
      would say nothing, do nothing, no matter what others might say or do. One
      dark night three masked men came to his house, murdered him, and took his
      money. They were not recognized, not traced, nor did any one then find
      out, nor does any one now know, who really did the deed; but it was then
      believed, and is still believed, that Moseby's guerilla band were the
      perpetrators.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same fall another instance occurred, in which Moseby's guerillas were
      certainly the actors, and which was of a much more warlike character.
    </p>
    <p>
      To cut off, gobble up, capture, or destroy paymasters and their escorts,
      quartermaster trains; and commissary trains, Colonel Moseby regarded as
      his special and particular province, and every one of his men was on the
      special look-out for chances of this kind. On the occasion now under
      consideration, Brevet Major Paymaster Tilletson was on his way from
      Williamsport to Shepherdstown, Md., accompanied by a captain, three
      lieutenants, and six privates&mdash;the latter and one lieutenant as an
      escort, the other officers returning to their respective commands from
      sick-leaves. Suddenly, without a moment's warning, Moseby, with a number
      of his gang, sprang out upon them, and, holding a cocked pistol at the
      head of each, demanded their surrender. Of course, they could do nothing
      but submit. Each officer was securely bound, while the privates were
      either killed or made their escape. In due time the whole party arrived
      within the Confederate lines, when the Union officers would probably have
      been made to illustrate Moseby's maxim, that "dead men tell no tales," had
      not an officer who had his authority direct from the War Department met
      him and ordered him to send the prisoners to Richmond. Moseby and his men
      helped themselves to so much of the greenbacks as they could conveniently
      carry, while tens of thousands of dollars were found next day scattered
      along the road between Williamsport and Shepherdstown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after the capture just related, Moseby and his men gobbled up
      another squad of officers, consisting of one major, two captains, and
      three lieutenants, who had been absent on sick-leaves and were then
      returning to their respective commands. After they had surrendered as
      prisoners of war, their money, watches, and everything they had of any
      value was taken from them. When fairly within the Confederate lines they
      were taken into a dense pine-grove, some distance off the road, and then
      told they were all to be hung so soon as the needed preparations could be
      made. Had a thunderbolt fallen at their feet from a clear sky, these six
      Union officers could not have been more surprised. All protested against
      such unmilitary, unusual, inhuman treatment&mdash;some begged for life,
      some wept; but the only reply they could get from Moseby was, "Prepare for
      death!" Providentially, as it would seem, one young man of Moseby's band
      had a "heart of flesh," and determined, if possible, to save the lives of
      these officers. He knew that an officer who had the authority to command
      Moseby (the same referred to in the preceding incident) was at a
      farm-house only a few miles from the pine-grove in which they had stopped
      for temporary encampment, and where these Union officers were to be
      executed. Slipping away from his comrades, he hastened to the farm-house
      to tell this officer of what Moseby proposed to do. So soon as the officer
      was told, he determined to stop it, if they could only reach there before
      the men were executed. The officer and private mounted fresh horses,
      borrowed from the farmer, and rode with breakneck speed until they reached
      the grove. It was quite dark, but the camp-fires of Moseby and his men
      lighted them to the spot. Springing from his horse at the edge of the
      grove, the officer left the two horses in care of the young man and
      hastened to where he saw the camp-fire burning. Stopping for a moment to
      survey the scene before making his presence known, he observed the six
      Union officers seated on a log on the opposite side of the fire from where
      he stood, each with head dropped upon his breast, each with eyes glaring
      wildly into vacancy or suffused with tears, each with lips pale with fear
      or moving in silent prayer, and each the very picture of despair in
      feature and attitude. Moseby was walking to and fro in front of them,
      uttering oaths and imprecations against them; guards stood about them or
      walked their rounds silently; while only a little way off, in plain sight,
      others were busy throwing over or affixing ropes to limbs preparatory for
      execution. It was a scene which only the pencil of a Raphael might have
      sketched or a Gorreggio have painted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer, having fully surveyed and comprehended the whole scene,
      suddenly sprang from the darkness into the light of the camp-fire, and in
      a sharp tone demanded of Colonel Moseby what all this meant.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You see what it means," Moseby replied, pointing to the men who were
      affixing the ropes to the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are these prisoners, and what have they done that you propose to hang
      them?" asked the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are d&mdash;d Yankee officers whom I captured this afternoon, and <i>purpose</i>
      to hang them to-night. Dead men never bite," answered Moseby.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I purpose," said the officer, "that you do no such thing; that these
      officers be sent under guard to Richmond, and that you yourself report
      there at once under arrest." Of course a good deal more was said, and a
      great many oaths uttered on both sides, but the above is about the
      substance. The Union officers heard and saw all that was said and done,
      but were so dumbfounded that they could not say a word or utter a cry even
      to each other. When they did finally comprehend it all, they regarded
      their deliverer as one sent from heaven, and were ready to fall down and
      worship him. The transition from death to life was so sudden, so
      unexpected, that it was some time before they could fully realize whether
      they were in the body or out of the body, whether their natural senses
      were still of the earth, earthy, or whether they had been suddenly
      translated to another sphere, where angels only sing "peace on earth and
      good will towards men!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In pursuance of the commanding officer's orders, the six Union officers
      were next day forwarded, as prisoners of war, to Richmond; while Moseby
      himself soon after reported at the Adjutant General's office under arrest,
      to await such action as the authorities might think proper in his case.
      And thus, and thus, were the lives of six more men saved from the infernal
      clutch and ravenous maw of this hyena in human form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not many days after, the same officer who had released from Moseby's
      clutch the six Union officers above spoken of, chanced to be riding along
      a public highway when he observed, at considerable distance off, in a deep
      gully, a man entirely naked, dodging from place to place, as if in fear or
      distress. The sight was so strange that the officer turned his horse's
      head and quickly rode to the place where he had first seen the man. Here
      he found not the one only, but three, all entirely naked, and all huddled
      together, as if to protect themselves from each other's sight. The officer
      demanded what it all meant. It was some moments before the men could
      answer at all, but when they did, they told the Confederate officer that
      they were three Union officers who had been gobbled up the day before by
      Moseby's guerillas, stripped of everything they had on earth, even to
      their shirts, and then left in that woods or ravine to do as best they
      might, with the warning, however, that if they made the least alarm they
      would be again caught and either hung or shot; that they had feared to
      approach any house in their nude state, lest they might be shot at as
      ghosts or wild men; that they had not had a morsel of food for a long
      time, and that even death was preferable to longer enduring such suspense
      and torture. The officer had seen inhumanity in almost every possible
      shape, but this, he said, was a refinement of cruelty which shocked him
      more than anything he had ever seen before. He went to a house, not far
      off, and obtained shirts for two, and a woman's chemise for one, with such
      other clothing as they chanced to have. Thus, partially dressed, he then
      took them to the house, where they remained while the officer went to
      other houses of the neighborhood to get enough additional clothing to
      cover their nakedness. He then had them accompany him to the nearest
      military command, where he turned them over as regular prisoners of war.
      And thus were three more clutched from the grasp of these bloodthirsty
      hyenas. Clutched from death, too, for had they not been seen and rescued
      by this officer, they would, in all human probability, have been sought
      for by the guerillas next day, and either shot or hung.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no month, and probably but few weeks or days, during the entire
      war that Moseby's guerillas were not planning or executing some villanous
      enterprise against the Union army or Union men; but we have room only for
      a few more, and these we will select from his operations in the Shenandoah
      Valley and vicinity during the summer and fall of 1864.
    </p>
    <p>
      In August, 1864, General Sheridan was assigned to the command of the
      Middle Military Division, comprising the Middle Department and the
      Departments of Washington, the Susquehanna, and West Virginia. Occupying
      the Shenandoah Valley, in front of Sheridan, General Early lay, with about
      eighteen thousand Confederate troops. To drive these troops out of, or at
      least further up, the Valley, and to keep them so employed that no part of
      them should be detached from Early to send to Hood in his defence of
      Atlanta against the attack of Sherman, was Sheridan's first concern during
      the summer and fall of '64. In pursuance of this plan, on the 10th of
      August, Sheridan began to move out his forces from Halltown for the
      possession of the Shenandoah Valley. When Early's positions were reached,
      he fell back, and continued to fall back, until he reached Fisher's Hill,
      beyond Strasburg. In pursuing Early, Sheridan had passed several gaps in
      the mountains which skirt the Valley, and left them unguarded. Moseby,
      learning of this, hastily got together as many of his guerillas as
      possible, dashed through Snicker's Gap on the 13th, struck Sheridan's
      supply-train, which was only guarded by Kenly's brigade of one hundred
      days' men, at Berryville, and, before the guard had fairly recovered from
      the panic, Moseby had captured the entire train, consisting of
      seventy-five wagons, from five to six hundred horses and mules, two
      hundred beef cattle, and a large quantity of stores. He also secured over
      two hundred prisoners. His own loss was only two killed and three wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attack and loss were so sudden, so unexpected, and so exaggerated in
      the telling from one soldier to another, that they seemed for the moment
      to paralyze Sheridan's entire army; so much so that he deemed it expedient
      to make a retrograde movement, which he continued until he reached, on the
      21st of August, a position about two miles out from Charlestown. While
      Sheridan was thus falling back from day to day, Moseby's guerillas hung
      upon his rear and flanks, treacherously capturing and killing whenever
      opportunity offered. In one instance, it is alleged, after taking some
      Union cavalrymen prisoners; after, indeed, they had fully surrendered as
      prisoners of war and <i>been disarmed</i>, Moseby ordered <i>every one of
      them</i> brutally murdered on the spot, in pursuance of his maxim that
      "dead men never bite." In retaliation for this terrible outrage, Sheridan
      ordered that from thenceforth every house and barn of these
      half-guerillas, half-farmers in the Valley, that could possibly be#
      reached by his cavalrymen, should be destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only in retaliation for this one act, but for scores of other acts of
      a like or worse character, of which they were cognizant, and with a view
      to strike terror into the minds of such men as had been, and still were,
      harboring and encouraging these guerillas&mdash;men who were farmers by
      day and robbers by night&mdash;both General Grant and General Sheridan
      determined to inaugurate a wholesale system of devastation in the
      localities where these outrages had been mostly carried on&mdash;especially
      in the Virginia counties of Shenandoah, Rockingham, Loudon, and Fauquier.
      As a result of this policy&mdash;or, more properly speaking, <i>as a
      result of the outrages which had been perpetrated by Moseby's guerillas</i>
      (for the policy would never have been thought of but for these outrages)&mdash;the
      following destruction of property is reported to have occurred in the four
      counties named, between the 1st of October, when the policy was
      inaugurated, and the forepart of December (1864), when Merritt's cavalry
      division crossed the Blue Ridge, and made a grand raid through the upper
      part of Loudon and Fauquier counties:
    </p>
    <p>
      In Shenandoah and Rockingham counties&mdash;according to the official
      report of a commissioner of the revenue to the Richmond authorities&mdash;"there
      were burned 18 dwelling-houses, 215 barns, 11 grist-mills, 9 water
      saw-mills, 2 steam saw-mills, 1 furnace, 2 forges, 1 fulling-mill, besides
      a number of smaller buildings, such as stables, etc. The quantity of grain
      destroyed is immense. I cannot give you any idea of the amount of grain,
      hay, fodder, etc., destroyed, but the quantity is very large."
    </p>
    <p>
      In Loudon and Fauquier counties&mdash;according to the official report
      made by General Sheridan to General Grant at the time&mdash;the property
      burned and captured was as follows: Burned&mdash;barns, 1168; mills, 49;
      tanneries, 1; factories, 2; distilleries, 6; tons of hay, 27,620; bushels
      of wheat, 51,500; bushels of corn, 62,900; bushels of oats, 2000;
      haystacks, 1121; wheatstacks, 57; stacks of other grains, 104. Captured&mdash;horses,
      388; mules, 8; cattle, 5520; sheep, 5837; swine, 1141. Total estimated
      value of property destroyed and captured in these two counties,
      $2,508,756.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be added, as a further reason for the destruction of wheat,
      corn, hay, etc., that General Lee had been drawing his supplies largely
      from these four counties, and it was therefore for the purpose of
      crippling Lee's army, as well as to punish these farmers for harboring and
      aiding Moseby's guerillas, that this wholesale destruction of property was
      planned and executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who have witnessed the distress following the burning of a single
      dwelling-house, or a single barn with contents, in a neighborhood of
      farmers, can form some faint idea of the distress which must have followed
      the burning of eighteen dwelling-houses, and 1383 barns, with all their
      contents, and with all the stacks of grain, hay, and fodder surrounding
      them! Even the thought is fearful,&mdash;how much more the reality! After
      what we have related of the operations of Moseby's guerillas&mdash;and
      what we have told is not a hundredth part of what might be told&mdash;none
      of our readers, we think, will question the propriety of the caption to
      this chapter, "Guerillas on the War-path&mdash;Cunning and Duplicity
      Prompting the Actors;" nor, after learning of the destruction of property
      which followed, will any one, we think, question the third line of the
      caption, "Destruction in the Background!"

      CHAPTER IX. WHAT BECAME OF SLAVES DURING AND AFTER THE WAR. THE ALMIGHTY
    </h2>
    <h3>
      DOLLAR PROMPTING THE ACTORS.&mdash;"WE NEBER SEED'EM ANY MORE."
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T is a
      well-attested fact, that there were many less slaves, or those who had
      been slaves, in the United States on the 9th of April, 1865, when General
      Lee surrendered to General Grant, near the Appomattox Court House, than
      when the war commenced by the firing on Fort Sumter, on the 12th of April,
      1861. Had there been no war, and had the ratio of increase been the same
      from 1861 to 1865 as it had been for the previous four years, there would
      have been several hundred thousand more in 1865 than there were in 1861.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also well known that from and after the 1st of January, 1863, when
      President Lincoln's proclamation of freedom to the slave&mdash;issued on
      the 22d of September, 1862&mdash;went into effect, many hundreds, if not
      thousands, of those who had been slaves were taken into the military
      service of the United States; that, when captured by the Confederate
      forces, they were not recognized as prisoners of war, but in many cases,
      as at Fort Pillow, were massacred like so many dogs; that thousands were
      destroyed in this way, and that many other thousands died on fields of
      battle; that many during the war tried to escape, but, being overtaken,
      were killed on sight by their former masters or their agents; that the
      excessive amount of labor which they were compelled to perform for their
      masters on plantations, and for the Confederate government, in digging
      rifle-pits and throwing up fortifications, lessened their power of
      reproduction, and caused thousands of premature deaths; but,
      notwithstanding all these facts, there still remains a very large number
      to be accounted for; and to account for these in part, if not wholly, is
      the object of the present chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The facts which we shall relate in this connection cannot fail to be as
      startling to our readers as they were to us. They have <i>never before
      been related,</i> either in book or newspaper form; nor would they now be,
      but that time has wiped out the passions of the war and the limits of
      personal responsibility, and made the facts legitimate for the purposes of
      history.
    </p>
    <p>
      That our readers may understand that no animosity towards the South, or
      the Southern Confederacy, nor sympathy with the slave in any way, has led
      to the divulging of these facts, we may say that Colonel Abercrombie, to
      whom we are indebted for the facts, is a Southern man (a Baltimorian) by
      birth, and from his earliest recollection was taught to look upon the
      negro as a different race from our own&mdash;as a chattel, to be bought
      and sold, the same as a horse or cow; that he was a captain in the
      Thirteenth United States Infantry in the early stages of the war, but,
      being convinced that his duty lay with the South, resigned his commission
      in the United States army, went South, joined the Confederate service, and
      remained as an officer in that service until the close of the war; and
      that it was not until soon after the war, when he went from New York to
      Galveston by steamship, and from Galveston travelled nearly all over Texas
      on horseback, that he became fully aware of the facts which he detailed to
      us, and which we now purpose to communicate to our readers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel, Captain Philip Lander, and three others, left Galveston for
      Brownsville about the middle of June, 1865. From Galveston to Houston they
      went by steamboat; at Houston they purchased mules, and from thenceforth
      pursued their journey on muleback. At Columbus they found a considerable
      number of Confederate soldiers, who had belonged to General Kirby Smith's
      command, and were then on their way to their homes. At Bastrop they found
      two companies of United States volunteers doing guard duty. At Austin, the
      capital of the State, they found General Sturges with four companies of
      the regiment which he commanded, the Seventh United States Cavalry. About
      the middle of July, they left Austin for San Antonio. On the road they saw
      two men in one place, and one in another, hanging by the neck to limbs of
      trees, who had been strung up there by roving banditti&mdash;probably on
      the suspicion that they were Union men&mdash;and left to hang there as a
      warning to others. At San Antonio they found General Magruder, who claimed
      that he had not yet surrendered, though "lying around loose," and, as they
      afterwards learned, was probably looking after the interests of slave
      exporters, rather than the interests of the Southern Confederacy. It was
      the latter part of August when they left San Antonio for Brownsville.
      After five days' travel from San Antonio, and just before reaching the
      branch road which leads to Brazos San Diego, from the main military road
      to Brownsville, they overtook a gang of from six to eight hundred negroes,
      in charge of, and driven along by, about forty white men, part Americans
      and part Mexicans. The negroes consisted of men, women, and children.
      There were no old men or old women among them. Some were handcuffed
      together; others were tied together with ropes; others not bound in any
      way. Some women were carrying children in their arms. All were on foot and
      seemed weary from long travel. Their drivers were all on horseback, some
      at the front, some at the sides, and some in the rear, all armed with
      pistols, all with whips in their hands, and all with curses in their
      mouths, which were hurled at the poor negroes on the slightest
      provocation. Like cattle drivers, or worse, those at the sides and rear
      were constantly hallooing, cursing, and saying to the negroes, "Git along!
      git along! Faster! faster!" with an oath between each command. Many of the
      women, especially such as were carrying children, seemed ready to faint
      from exhaustion, and often turned their faces beseechingly, and with tears
      in their eyes, towards their drivers, but their pleadings were only met by
      curses, still louder and still deeper, from their inhuman captors and
      drivers. Behind the gang were three two-wheeled carts and an old
      ambulance, in the first of which rations, etc., were carried; in the
      ambulance, besides old clothes, lay a woman whom the drivers said "was
      about to kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel and his party rode along with this negro-driving party some
      three or four hours, meanwhile gathering from their own lips all they
      could relative to the character and extent of the business; how, when, and
      where inaugurated; how and to whom they sold their human chattels; what
      the profits of the business, and with whom the profits were divided; what
      part, if any, the former owner got, etc., etc. The drivers were not at all
      disposed to be communicative, nevertheless a considerable amount of
      information was drawn from them, part of which led to other clues, which,
      being followed up, led to additional information, the whole resulting in a
      development of the facts embraced in this chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the branch road before spoken of was reached, the negro-drivers, with
      their drove of human chattels, turned off for Brazos San Diego, while the
      Colonel and his party pursued their way to Brownsville (opposite
      Matamoras), which they reached on the following day. Here, too, they saw a
      considerable number of negroes in confinement, awaiting boats to take them
      down the Rio Grande River and thence to a market. From Brownsville the
      Colonel and his party went into Mexico, where they remained about six
      months. In February, 1866, the Colonel returned to Texas, and while
      stopping some time with Mr. Higgins, a large landowner and extensive
      cattle raiser, near Bastrop, overheard a Mexican ask his son, William
      Higgins, to get up a fandango at his saw-mills and invite all the negroes
      of the neighborhood, in order that he (the Mexican) and his party might
      have opportunity to seize some of the negroes and run them off to a
      market. This, it will be borne in mind, was about ten months after the
      close of the war, about six months since the Colonel had seen the drove of
      negroes on the road to Brazos San Diego, and about <i>three years</i>
      after President Lincoln's proclamation went into effect, declaring freedom
      to every slave within the limits of the Southern Confederacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, the Colonel was surprised at hearing such a proposition, and,
      though as much of a pro-slavery man as any one could be after all that had
      transpired, still felt curious to know all about this new business, or old
      business, as it might happen to be, of kidnapping, running off, and
      selling such as had been slaves. His inquiries resulted in developing the
      following facts:
    </p>
    <p>
      For many years prior to the war the breeding and raising of negroes had
      become as much of a standard business in Virginia as the planting and
      raising of cotton had formerly been, or as the breeding and raising of
      cattle still is in Texas. As the lands became poorer in Virginia from long
      cultivation, the raising of crops became less and less profitable, until
      it was finally discovered that to raise about enough of crops to supply
      themselves and their negroes with bread and clothing, and to devote all
      else of their thoughts and energies to the raising of negroes for market
      and use in States where the climate and quality of soil made the raising
      of cotton and rice a remunerative business, would, in the long run, be
      much more profitable to them. This, therefore, became the general sense of
      the State, and from thenceforth was generally pursued throughout the
      State. This necessitated middlemen, or slave merchants&mdash;such as would
      purchase the slave of the Virginia farmer at such price as might be agreed
      upon, take him or her to his place of business, put them in the best
      possible trim for a market, and then take them off in droves to South
      Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, or wherever else needed, and sell them at
      private or public sale for the best prices they could obtain. Whatever
      inhumanity there might be in such business, it certainly resulted in large
      profits, especially to the dealers, and hence it is not at all surprising
      that a great many should have been engaged in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the war commenced there were hundreds, if not thousands, of these
      slave-dealers throughout the South. Some went into the army; some, who had
      well-filled purses, fled to Cuba, to 'Canada, to Nassau, to England; while
      others, too poor to get away, too cowardly to fight, too lazy to work, and
      too ignorant to do any business other than what they had been doing,
      remained in the country and continued to ply their vocation whenever and
      wherever opportunity offered. It was a fixed policy with the Confederate
      Government not to allow slaves to be taken or sold beyond their bounds,
      and that every possible precaution be taken to prevent the escape of
      slaves into the Union lines; but the Government had no objection to the
      sale and transfer of slaves from Virginia to Georgia, or to any other of
      the Confederate States, and as the Union army advanced into Virginia,
      rather encouraged such sales and transfers, to prevent the escape of
      slaves into the Union lines. The effect of this was to make an active and
      very profitable business for slave-dealers, and to largely increase the
      number of slaves in the more southern of the Confederate States.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, besides going into Virginia, Union armies commenced forward
      movements into Kentucky and Tennessee, into Missouri and Arkansas, it was
      deemed expedient to run off a large number of the slaves of those States
      into Texas, the better to secure them from capture by the Union armies,
      and have them where they could be shipped to foreign ports, if not
      thereafter needed by the States of the Confederacy, or if, peradventure,
      the Confederacy itself might fail of success. When, on the 16th of
      November, 1864, Sherman commenced his march "from Atlanta to the sea," a
      like necessity of getting slaves beyond the reach of Union soldiers
      existed in all the Gulf States, and so far as it was possible to get them
      into Texas it was done. How many thousands, yea, how many hundreds of
      thousands were thus driven into Texas from other Confederate States, God
      only knows, or will ever know!
    </p>
    <p>
      This particular route was made necessary because of the blockading of
      Southern ports; and because once in Texas, they could be held there until
      the result of the war was known. It was not, as before stated, the policy
      of the Confederate Government to have the slaves taken beyond their
      control, as the corner-stone of the Confederacy was to be slavery, and the
      more they could have of it the greater, they thought, would be their
      prosperity; nor was it the policy of the slave-dealer to take his chattel
      beyond the reach of the best market in the world, so long as there was a
      reasonable prospect of that market being kept open. In Texas the dealer
      had the double chance&mdash;either to return with his human chattels to
      the Confederate States, in case it became an established government, or,
      if that failed, then to ship them from Brazos San Diego, from Brownsville,
      from Corpus Christi, from Powder Horn, or from any other port that might
      not be blockaded, to Cuba, to Brazil, or wherever else slavery existed and
      a market could be found. These slave-dealers watched the result of the
      contest between the North and the South with the same interest that
      stock-jobbers and gold-gamblers watched the rise and fall of stocks, and
      the rise and fall of gold, when they had a large quantity of either on
      hand, and were waiting to turn their speculation to the best possible
      account. When news would reach them that the Union armies were carrying
      everything before them, off would go one or more cargoes of negroes to
      Cuba or Brazil. When, by the next mail probably, news would reach them
      that the Confederate armies were meeting with great successes, making it
      probable that a Southern Confederacy would be established, they would
      regret that they had sent any away, and hold the firmer to those they had
      left. The price at which slaves could be sold&mdash;especially at forced
      or hurried sales&mdash;in the Brazil and Cuban markets, was far less than
      what they could reasonably hope to obtain in the Southern Confederacy, <i>provided</i>
      it became an acknowledged government.
    </p>
    <p>
      When shipments of negroes were commenced from the Texan ports heretofore
      named, and how often, or to what extent they were made, we are unable to
      say definitely; but the probabilities are that they commenced immediately
      after President Lincoln issued his proclamation of freedom to the slaves,
      September 22, 1862, and were made, to a greater or less extent, thereafter
      as news reached the dealers elevating or depressing their hopes of a
      permanent Southern Confederacy. After Sherman commenced his march from
      Chattanooga to Atlanta, in May, 1864, and especially after he resumed his
      march from Atlanta to Savannah, in November, 1864, and still more
      especially after he commenced his march from Savannah to Charleston, and
      thence to Richmond, in January, 1865, the slave-dealers in Texas thought
      they saw the handwriting on the wall, "Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin"&mdash;"Thou
      art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting," and from thenceforth
      every steamer, schooner, or water-craft of any kind, that could carry ten
      or more persons, and which they could possibly procure in any way, was
      secured to run the negroes from Texas to such markets as it were possible
      to reach. They could not be taken to the principal open ports of either
      Cuba or Brazil, lest, being seen by an anti-slavery man, the facts might
      be reported to United States consuls and thence to the United States
      government; but they were taken to out-of-the-way places along the coast
      of both countries, where copartners in the business were in waiting to
      receive and make further disposition of them. The money received from
      sales was sent back to the copartners in Texas by the partner or agent
      bringing out the last lot, and thus a flow of negroes in one direction,
      and a flow of money, with which to buy more, in another direction, was
      kept up constantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not necessary in all cases to make purchases and payments.
      Indeed, towards the close of the war, actual purchases were seldom made,
      and after the close of the war, none at all, though the business still
      remained active. The plan pursued was this: a dealer would go to a
      planter, to a farmer, or to a man living in town or city, and ask him how
      many slaves he owned. The answer would be ten, twenty, fifty, one hundred,
      or more, as the case might be; but he would probably add, immediately
      after, that only one-half, or one-fourth, or less were then with him&mdash;the
      others were hired out, or with the army, helping to dig trenches, or
      running at large, he did not know where. The dealer, after explaining to
      the owner the nature of his business, would propose to take from him a
      written bill of sale of all the negroes he owned take his own chances of
      catching them when and where he could, send them to a market when and
      where he could, and divide with the owner whatever might be the net result
      of sales. The owner, reasoning from the standpoint that "a half loaf is
      better than no bread," and that if the Confederacy proved a failure he
      would get nothing at all for his slaves, would enter into such written
      agreement with the dealer. With this in his pocket, to assure him from
      interference from pro-slavery men, and to prove to all who might question
      him that his business was of a "mercantile," rather than of a kidnapping,
      character, the dealer and his agents would go forth to seize the negroes&mdash;men,
      women, and children&mdash;for whom he had bills of sale in his pocket. If
      resisted by a white man, out would come his bill of sale to prove title;
      if resisted by a black man, he was shot down or hung on the spot; if
      resisted by the alleged slave, he was at once handcuffed, gagged, and
      marched away; if identity was questioned by a white man, the questioner
      had to prove property, while the bill of sale held by the dealer was
      regarded as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of his right to the person
      claimed; if identity was questioned by the person seized, or by any other
      colored man, he was laughed at, gagged, or shot down. In this way
      thousands were seized, thousands driven from where seized into Texas, and
      tens of thousands run from Texas to Brazilian and Cuban ports.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the close of the war, the fact that they had been made free by
      proclamation and by law spread rapidly among those who had been slaves,
      and from thenceforth the business of kidnapping and running them off
      became much more dangerous. While travelling through Texas, our informant
      met many negroes on the road with pistols at their sides, or guns upon
      their shoulders, and, when asked what it meant, they would reply, "Des am
      dangerous times, sa; we has to protect ourselves, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw, too, as before stated, both black men and white men hanging to the
      limbs of trees by the roadside, some of whom, doubtless, had been hung
      there because of resistance to kidnappers. All manner of means were
      devised by these kidnappers to catch the negroes when and where they could
      make the least resistance and the least noise. Even <i>ten months after
      the war;</i> as before stated, one of these dealers&mdash;the partner,
      probably, of an extensive firm, made up of both Americans and Mexicans&mdash;proposed
      to William Higgins to get up a fandango, or dance, at his saw-mills, and
      invite thereto all the negroes in the neighborhood, for the purpose, and
      only for the purpose, of enabling these kidnappers to seize and run off as
      many as could be ensnared within the trap, or got hold of; and, as we have
      seen, it was <i>four months after the war</i> that the drove of from six
      to eight hundred negroes were seen on the road to Brazos San Diego.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be a wonder with some readers how it was possible to continue such
      a business after Union troops had been stationed at Austin, the capital of
      the State, under so able a commander as General Sturges; and after they
      had been stationed at Bastrop, and at other large towns throughout the
      State. The explanation is simply this: While the sentiment of the Union
      troops was entirely opposed to any such traffic, and while, in pursuance
      of law, their duty plainly was to hang any man whom they found engaged in
      such a business, yet the sentiment of the white people, among whom the
      troops were located, was largely, if not universally, in favor of the
      traffic, and hence they would not inform against those who were engaged in
      it; and had the troops learned of, and attempted to arrest, any of the
      parties, every white man of the town or neighborhood would have risen in
      arms and attempted the rescue of the parties. Law, without public
      sentiment to sustain it, is a dead letter, or nearly so, under all
      circumstances, and where public sentiment is decidedly opposed to a law,
      its execution is next to impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another wonder, scarcely less than the first, will be with some readers,
      how it could be possible that honorable men&mdash;men whose personal
      characters before the war were above reproach, either from Southern or
      Northern men; men who had led consistent Christian lives, and who had been
      regarded as bright and shining lights in their respective church
      organizations, could permit such things to be done before their very eyes,
      and look on indifferently, if not approvingly. The explanation is this:
      Most of this business of running off slaves was done without the knowledge
      of the Confederate authorities. Indeed, had it come to their ears during
      the earlier stages of the war they would have done what they could to
      prevent it, however indifferent they might have been to it during the last
      year or last few months of the war. But a far weightier reason is, that
      what seems so heinous, so diabolical, so criminal indeed, to a Northern
      anti-slavery man, was, in the eyes of a Southern pro-slavery man, only a
      fair business transaction, based on Bible authority, State law, and the
      law of self-preservation. They regarded these negroes as much the property
      of those who had owned them, as horses or cattle would have been. Nor did
      they regard the proclamation of President Lincoln and the acts of
      Congress, whereby slaves were declared free, with any more awe or respect
      than they would have regarded a like proclamation, or like acts of
      Congress, if issued or made with regard to horses or cattle. Hence, to
      their consciences it was no more of a sin to seize and run off to a market
      these negroes during the war, or even after the war, than it would have
      been to seize or run off from the grasp of an enemy a like number of
      horses or cattle. That conscience is largely dependent on surroundings,
      and on education, is no longer a disputable question among mental
      philosophers. That the cannibal, who kills and eats his fellow-man, is
      just as conscientious in what he does as the man who kills and eats a
      lamb, is now a generally admitted fact. With this philosophic truth as a
      stand-point from which to look at the subject, who can doubt that General
      Polk, who for so many years had been the universally respected and highly
      beloved Bishop of the diocese of Louisiana, was just as conscientious in
      his advocacy of slavery, and in his defence of the Southern Confederacy,
      as Bishop Simpson was in his opposition to slavery and his advocacy of the
      Union. Who can doubt that General Pendleton, who had been for so many
      years a reverend doctor in the Episcopal Church, and the head of a
      seminary near Alexandria, Va., and who never gave the order to fire
      without first raising his eyes heavenward and saying, "God have mercy on
      their souls," was just as conscientious in the belief that slavery was
      justified by the Bible, and approved of by God, as John Wesley was in the
      belief that "slavery was the sum of all villanies"? Who can doubt that
      General Jackson ("Stonewall"), with whom the Bible was a constant
      companion, who prayed while he marched, who prayed when he encamped, who
      prayed even while directing the movements of a battle, was just as
      conscientious in his belief that slavery was right, as Wendell Phillips
      was that slavery was wrong; just as conscientious in the belief that the
      Southern Confederacy should succeed, in order to make slavery perpetual in
      this country, as General Birney was that the Union cause should succeed,
      if for no other reason than to wipe out slavery once and forever from the
      United States. This, certainly, is the charitable view to take of the
      whole subject; nor, with our present knowledge of ethics and mental
      philosophy, is it any more charitable than true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reason about it as we may, however, the fact remains that tens of
      thousands, probably hundreds of thousands, were driven out and run out of
      the United States in the manner indicated, and are now, if still alive,
      toiling as slaves in other lands; and that many a father, many a mother,
      many a sister, and many a brother, after their loved ones had been thus
      kidnapped and taken away, without any knowledge upon the part of their
      friends, have had reason to cry out in the bitterness of their souls, "<i>We
      neber seed 'em any more!"</i>

      CHAPTER X. THE CONFEDERACY AS SEEN FROM WITHIN. PRIDE, PASSION, AND WANT

    <h3>
      IN THE BACKGROUND.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>INCE the war, we
      have seen, and had long conversations with, a reverend doctor, whom we had
      known for many years previous to the war, who resided in Virginia when the
      war commenced, was among the first to take part in it, and who continued
      in the service until the war closed. We have also met other Confederate
      officers since the war, some of whom had extraordinary facilities for
      obtaining information while the war continued. From all these we learned
      much beyond anything we had ever known before, or ever seen in newspapers
      or books. To put on record some of the things so learned is the object of
      the present chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The South well knew, in the very beginning of the contest, that in point
      of numbers, in wealth, and in material resources, it was greatly inferior
      to the North. They had hope, however, of dividing the North, or, rather,
      of having the North divide against itself; and had the one-hundredth part
      of the promises made them by Northern men been kept, there would indeed
      have been a division of force, as well as a division of political
      sentiment, in the North; and the result of such division might have given
      the final victory to the Confederacy, instead of to the Union cause. But
      what the South relied upon still more, was assistance from England. They
      had been led to believe that King Cotton was almost, if not quite, as
      powerful in England as Queen Victoria, and they had laid the "flattering
      unction to their souls" that so soon as King Cotton saw those who had made
      him king in distress, he would rush, pell-mell, to their rescue; scatter
      the Yankee blockading squadrons to the winds; throw open all the Southern
      ports; bring men, ammunition, clothing, and provisions to exchange for
      their cotton, and thus, beyond any reasonable doubt, insure success to the
      Southern cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      As well assured as they felt of all this, they still regarded it as
      important to keep all the while the "best foot foremost;" to keep up an <i>appearance</i>
      of strength, however weak they might be; to keep up a show of
      independence, however much they might be hoping and praying for help. Like
      as an expectant bride, though she has the plighted faith of her lover,
      will continue to smile, to dress, to allure in every way she can, up to
      the very hour of the marriage ceremony, so the South continued to smile,
      to dress, to allure, in every way she could, her Northern allies, who had
      solemnly plighted their faith to her, and her English sympathizers, whose
      pecuniary interests lay all in that direction, and these things she
      continued to do up to the very moment when the Confederacy collapsed, and
      when it was found that nothing was left of the egg but the shell. As our
      reverend friend said to us, over and over again, and as other Confederate
      officers have said to us, over and over again, "none but those within the
      lines, and behind the scenes, knew of the destitution, of the suffering,
      of the heart-aches, of the skeletons within closets while those who held
      the keys were smiling as if they were full of good things, of the turns
      and shifts which not only the army but which almost every family in the
      South had to make, in order to preserve life, and yet keep up a fair
      outside show, during those four terrible years of war." And now for the
      illustrations&mdash;little or none of which has ever before been
      published.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first year of the war, so much in want of food was the
      Confederate army at times, that, in one instance, an officer, with an
      escort, travelled sixty miles before he could purchase food enough to load
      one six-mule wagon which he had with him. Even then they had to go within
      the Union lines, and run very great risk of being captured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same officer from whom we learned the above incident, also told us
      that, on one occasion, he and the men with him were so ravenous from
      hunger that he shot an old sow that had had a large litter of pigs only
      the day before, and that while he and his fellow officers ate the meat (if
      meat it could be called) of the old sow, his men ate not only the
      one-day-old pigs, but even the very entrails of the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      On another occasion this same officer shot an opossum that had just been
      having its young, and while, under ordinary circumstances, he could no
      more have eaten its flesh than he could have eaten a viper, yet such was
      his hunger at the time that the dish seemed palatable. Often, he said, he
      had gone for a whole day, and occasionally two or three days at a time,
      without one "square meal;" and this he knew to be an ordinary experience
      among officers of the Confederate army, especially during the last year of
      the war, and largely so during the two or three last years of the war.
      Certainly, if there was an officer in that army who had opportunities to
      live on the "fat of the land," he was one of them, and if he suffered
      thus, God only knows what must have been the sufferings of others!
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the war, coffee became scarce, and, during the last year or two,
      hardly to be had at all within the lines of the Confederacy. To procure
      it, all manner of devices were resorted to. On one occasion, when two
      sentinels were within calling distance of each other&mdash;one on either
      side of an intervening deep ravine&mdash;a Confederate officer present
      told his sentinel to ask the Union sentinel whether his company had any
      coffee which they would exchange for tobacco. The Union sentinel inquired
      of his captain, and after a time hallooed back that they had of their
      company rations a bag of coffee left over, which they would exchange for
      tobacco, provided they could make a good trade. The Confederate officer
      instructed his sentinel to reply that they would give twenty-five boxes of
      plug tobacco for one bag of coffee. The offer was accepted, and as soon
      after as the coffee and the tobacco could be brought to the spot, the
      Union sentinel rolled down the bag of coffee, the Confederate sentinel
      rolled down the twenty-five boxes of tobacco, to the foot of the ravine,
      when, with assistants, each took away the article traded for&mdash;hostilities
      being suspended meanwhile. Each of the parties was highly pleased with the
      trade. Before the war one or two boxes of tobacco would have brought in
      the New York market as much, if not more, than one bag of coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pins and needles became so scarce in the Confederacy that at least one man&mdash;a
      Mr. Webster Sly, of Charles County, Md., brother to a celebrated doctor in
      that vicinity&mdash;made quite a fortune by smuggling trunks full of these
      articles across the Union lines and selling them within the Confederate
      lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      As early as 1863, one of our informants saw dogs in the streets of
      Charleston so emaciated that they could scarcely walk, and at one time saw
      one of these animals leaning against a fence and chewing upon an old shoe.
      In that city and in Richmond he knew of families who had once been wealthy
      that were, during the war, compelled to sell not only their clothing, but
      even their beds, to procure food to live upon. Our reverend friend
      himself, though at one time the owner of a handsome house and of slaves,
      had, while at Petersburg, been compelled to live, with his wife and
      daughter, in a garret, and upon food that a dog would scarcely have eaten
      under ordinary circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only did such destitution prevail throughout the Confederate States
      during the war, but still worse evils prevailed, engendered by pride,
      jealousy, and passion. While this fact was carefully concealed from
      Northern eyes and ears, and from English eyes and ears, yet it prevailed
      to an alarming extent, and when occasionally it would burst forth in such
      violence as to cause death, no mention of the fact was made in the
      newspapers at Richmond lest it might reach Northern or English ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost at the beginning of the war two parties sprang up in the
      Confederacy, known as the "Davis party" and the "Stephens party."
      President Davis advocated one line of policy; Vice-President Stephens
      advocated another line of policy. Their respective friends took sides,
      each with his chief, and so bitter became the strife between the two, that
      when the Government was removed from Montgomery to Richmond Mr. Stephens
      would not come there to preside over the deliberations of the Senate. At
      one time, in 1863, the strife between their respective partisans in the
      Confederate Congress, then meeting in Richmond, became so great, that a
      Virginian (a Davis man) shot and killed a Georgian (a Stephens man) upon
      the floor of the House for some words uttered in debate. The excitement
      for the moment was intense. Pistols and bowie-knives were drawn by dozens
      of Congressmen, and it seemed that many additional lives would have to be
      sacrificed then and there before the affray could end, but erelong quiet
      was restored and the dead body of the slain member removed from the
      chamber. Our informant saw the dead body as it was carried along the
      street, inquired after and learned all the incidents of the bloody affair,
      but neither on that day nor on any day thereafter was a word said about it
      in the Richmond newspapers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another cause of much irritation, much jealousy, and much bad blood, arose
      in the appointing of general officers for the Confederate army. Mr. Davis,
      being himself a "West-Pointer," it was not unnatural that he should
      prefer, in all cases, graduates of West Point; but, as the people of the
      several States had to furnish not only the money, but the men for the
      army, it was not unnatural that they should desire to see some of their
      leading citizens in command of the men they furnished. The people believed
      that brains were quite as essential to success as technical military
      knowledge, and were not willing to trust all their interests, personal and
      pecuniary, to the direction of such as knew little or nothing beyond
      military tactics. The demand became so strong and so persistent that the
      administration yielded, so far as to appoint Bishop Polk, Rev. Dr.
      Pendleton, John C. Breckinridge, and Bradley Johnson, to generalships; but
      beyond this, few, if any, held high positions in the army, other than
      West-Point-ers. Towards the close of the war, General Lee said, at a
      dinner given to army officers, at Orange Court-House, near his
      headquarters, that from thenceforth the "policy of the government would be
      to give promotion to such, and such only, as fairly earned it on the field
      of battle, without regard to their previous military education." This
      speech was reported at once in every part of the Confederacy, and as he
      was presumed to speak by authority, it had the effect to quiet, in a great
      measure, the excitement which had so long existed relative to military
      appointments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another source of demoralization, and, consequently, of weakness in the
      Confederacy, was the disposition to gamble among so many of its officers
      and leading citizens. At Richmond, while so many, who had been affluent,
      were almost starving; while the gradual disappearance, and finally the
      entire absence, of cats and dogs in the city, proved that meat other than
      lamb was supplying the tables of many of its citizens; while even the
      highest officers of State were, at times, sorely perplexed about food for
      their families, the gambling houses of that city were doing a splendid
      business, and furnishing free lunches to their patrons far superior to
      what could be found upon the table of President Davis or any member of his
      cabinet. Indeed, it became well known among Confederate army officers, and
      among the leading gentlemen of the city as well, that the best eatables
      and the best drinkables to be had in the Confederacy were to be had at
      these gambling saloons, and many a one was induced to patronize them on
      this account more than on any other. It was said that the proprietors of
      these saloons could obtain, and did obtain, supplies from the North, when
      the highest officers and the wealthiest men of Richmond could not obtain
      them. How done, except through pals and noted gamblers, some of whom were
      well-known spies, and often in Washington, was never known.
      Notwithstanding the expensive free lunches given by these gambling houses
      every day, they made immense amounts of money. What they made in gold and
      greenbacks they carefully stored away, or made use of in the purchase of
      supplies. What they got in Confederate money they invested in real estate,
      so that, when the war ended, the gamblers of Richmond owned more real
      estate than any other class of persons, if not more than all other classes
      combined. What was true of Richmond, in all these particulars, was
      probably true of every other city in the Confederacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still another source of weakness in the Confederacy was the lack of
      confidence; almost from the beginning, in the currency issued by the
      government, or by its authority. It was thought to be a terrible condition
      of things in the North when a gold dollar commanded $2.85 in greenbacks;
      when muslin, that had sold for ten cents per yard, sold for thirty; when
      coffee, sugar, meats, almost everything, commanded double, and, in some
      cases, treble the prices at which they had sold before the war; but these
      were as nothing when compared with the South. A single chicken leg, or a
      single chicken wing, with a small piece of corn-bread tied to it, sold at
      from one to two dollars at many of the railroad depots; a drink of brandy
      or whiskey, at the Ballard House, Richmond, cost five dollars; a single
      meal, at the same house, ten dollars; a gentleman's dressing-gown,
      smuggled through from the North by a land blockade-runner, sold, in
      Richmond, for eleven hundred dollars. Of course, all these prices mean
      Confederate currency. Such as were wise enough to invest their Confederate
      money in real estate had something of real value after the war. Such as
      failed to do this, had large amounts in what purported to be money, but
      not one penny in real value, after the war ended. Every dollar of gold or
      silver that came within the Confederate lines, after the second year of
      the war, was either hoarded or hid away, or expended for needed supplies,
      in which case it soon found its way back to the North or to England.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus we close this tenth scene of the drama, in which we have
      endeavored to give our readers a glimpse of the Southern Confederacy as
      seen from within; and to show, too, that pride, passion, and want formed a
      fearful picture in the background.

      CHAPTER XI. HOW ORDER WAS MAINTAINED. KINDNESS AND POWER (HAND-IN-HAND)
    </h2>
    <h3>
      BEHIND THE SCENES.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE city of
      Alexandria is situated about seven miles below Washington, on the Potomac
      River. It was at one time a part of the District of Columbia, but, by a
      subsequent arrangement, was retroceded to Virginia. Prior to the war it
      was a place of considerable business; contained, probably, thirty thousand
      inhabitants; had some fine streets, and a few handsome buildings; and was
      a favorite place of resort, as well as of residence, for the more wealthy
      and influential citizens of that part of Virginia.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the war commenced, by the firing on Fort Sumter, the first object of
      the United States Government was to save Washington from falling into the
      hands of the enemy. Between the 18th of May and the 23d of June, 1861,
      thirty-one fully organized regiments and three independent companies
      arrived in that city. Of these, four were from Pennsylvania, also the
      three independent companies, four from Massachusetts, eleven from New York
      State, four from New Jersey, two from Rhode Island, three from
      Connecticut, one from Michigan, and two from Ohio. These regiments
      numbered about 28,000 men. Besides these, there were about 4,000 District
      of Columbia militia, organized under Colonel Stone, and about 4,000
      regular United States troops. All these were concentrated, thus early, for
      the defence of the capital, and to form a pivot for future movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though these volunteer regiments had had but little opportunity for drill,
      the impatience of the North soon made it necessary for them to make a
      forward movement of some kind; and, as Alexandria was the most approximate
      point, and as a considerable force of the Confederates were known to be
      concentrated there, it was resolved to make an attack upon, and, if
      possible, capture that city. Accordingly, at midnight on the 23d of May,
      1861, a small force was pushed across the Long Bridge to the Virginia
      side, to clear and hold the head of the bridge; and at two o'clock on the
      following morning a considerable force left Washington on foot, while a
      regiment of Zouaves, under command of Colonel Ellsworth, left on two
      steamers&mdash;all for Alexandria. The movement was so concerted that the
      force on foot reached the outskirts of the city at the same time that
      Ellsworth's force reached the wharves. The Confederate force at Alexandria
      was far too small to contend with the Union force sent against them, and
      as the one entered the other retired from the city. But for the
      unfortunate death of Colonel Ellsworth, who was shot by James Jackson, the
      proprietor of the Marshall House, while the former was removing a
      Confederate flag which had been flying from the flag-staff of that hotel,
      and the killing of Jackson, which followed immediately after, there would
      have been no blood shed in the capture of that city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only did the Confederate troops retire on the approach of the Union
      troops, but a large number of families and single citizens left at the
      same time. Indeed, for several days previous to the coming of the Union
      troops, it was well known in Alexandria that they were coming, and many of
      its citizens, some of whom owned farms in other parts of Virginia, some
      plantations in other parts of the South, and others who had friends and
      relatives in other parts of the State, or in other parts of the South, had
      all quietly left for their respective farm-homes, plantations, or friends.
      Some who could not leave thus suddenly went as soon as they could
      thereafter, so that, before a Union line had been fully established beyond
      Alexandria, probably two-thirds of its citizens had left, leaving only
      about ten thousand out of a previous population of about thirty thousand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately thereafter, however, the Union forces commenced to establish
      camps at points beyond, yet not far from, Alexandria. Near the Seminary
      buildings, only a few miles from the city, a considerable number of troops
      were encamped; while, at Malvern Hills, at Edsall's farm, at or near
      Fall's Church, and at many other points, regiments, brigades, or whole
      divisions were located. As a consequence of this, notwithstanding
      Alexandria had been so largely abandoned by its own citizens, its streets
      were more thronged with citizens and soldiers combined, its drinking
      saloons were more frequented, and there was more of bustle and confusion
      generally in the city during the summer, fall, and winter of 1861 than
      there had ever been in any past period of its history.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the hasty leaving of the leading citizens of Alexandria had gone
      whatever it had possessed of municipal, county, or State government. The
      mayor and members of the city council had fled; all the State and county
      judges had fled; the county clerk, the surrogate, and every other county
      officer had fled; nor was there a single justice of the peace, a single
      constable, or a single police-officer&mdash;or, at least, not one who
      declared himself as such&mdash;left in the city. There was no formal
      announcement of the establishing of martial law within the city limits,
      but its possession by Union troops made it virtually so from the moment
      they took possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      The battle of Bull Run occurred on the 21st of July, 1861, and although
      Alexandria had been bad enough before that time, it was still worse after.
      For some time after that battle the Union army seemed utterly demoralized.
      The commanders of regiments, brigades, and divisions seemed for the moment
      to have lost all control over their men. Officers and men, instead of
      remaining in camp to drill, flocked into Washington and into Alexandria by
      scores, yea, by hundreds, every day. Hotels, drinking saloons,
      restaurants' houses of ill-fame were all doing a rushing business, and
      meanwhile the legitimate duties of the officer and the soldier were almost
      wholly neglected. General McClellan reached Washington, and assumed
      command of the Army of the Potomac, on the 26th of July, 1861, and on the
      30th issued an order in which he said, "The general commanding the
      division has with much regret observed that large numbers of officers and
      men stationed in the vicinity of Washington (his command included
      Alexandria and beyond as well) are in the habit of frequenting the streets
      and hotels of the city. This practice is eminently prejudicial to good
      order and discipline, and must at once be discontinued." This order had a
      salutary effect to a certain extent, but it by no means cured the evil. It
      made officers and men more careful to procure leaves of absence and passes
      before leaving their camps; for, if found in Washington or Alexandria
      without such leave or pass, they were liable to be called upon by the
      provost-marshal, or arrested by the provost-guard; but, after the first
      week or two, in the lessening of numbers the effect of the order was
      hardly perceptible. The hotels, drinking saloons, restaurants, and houses
      of ill-fame still continued to do a thriving business; while fights in
      saloons, brawls in the streets, insults to persons walking the streets,
      thefts, robberies, and the like misdemeanors, were of almost daily and
      nightly occurrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the condition of things in Alexandria, when, in August, 1861,
      General William R. Montgomery, who had been the Colonel of the First New
      Jersey regiment of volunteers, but had recently been promoted to a
      brigadier-generalship, was detached from his command, then encamped near
      the Seminary buildings, and assigned to the command (as Military Governor)
      of Alexandria. He had for his Assistant Adjutant-General, Jacob R. Freese,
      of Trenton, N. J., who had been an active business-man all his life (he
      was then about thirty-five years of age), and who for the four years
      immediately preceding the war had been the editor and proprietor of the <i>State
      Gazette</i>, one of the leading newspapers of the State. General
      Montgomery was then about sixty years of age, a graduate of West Point,
      had been connected with the regular army nearly all his life&mdash;a
      perfect gentleman in his manners, mild, quiet, unobtrusive, exceedingly
      kind and gentle; but knew comparatively nothing of business life, and had
      hardly been in a police-office or a courtroom during his whole life.
      Though no officer in the army was truer to the Union cause than he, yet so
      exceedingly kind was he in his general disposition, so disliked to refuse
      any favor asked of him, and so averse was he to punishment of any kind,
      that he soon found his new situation a very perplexing one. Hardly had he
      assumed command, before such of the secessionists as remained in
      Alexandria commenced to ask favors at his hands. In all cases, where he
      possibly could, it gave him as much or more pleasure to grant their
      requests than for them to receive the favors. This soon became known to
      extreme Unionists, who thereupon called the General "a rebel in disguise."
      When this came to the General's ears, it distressed him greatly. It also
      distressed him as much, or more, to learn that some Alexandrians who
      remained were practising great cruelty towards some white citizens, and
      especially towards their slaves, because they had dared to express Union
      sentiments. And still another source of great annoyance to him was, that
      great numbers of soldiers came into the city every day&mdash;some got
      drunk, abused citizens, created brawls in the streets, and then left
      without so much as saying "by your leave, sir." Other disputes and
      disturbances were occurring, almost daily, among the citizens, which, when
      all other means failed, would be referred to him for settlement, since, as
      heretofore stated, there were no courts left in the city to whom such
      disputes could be referred. To organize a court-martial and keep it in
      session all the while would take a number of officers from their regular
      duties, and seemed utterly impracticable. To undertake to arbitrate and
      decide all cases himself, seemed not less impracticable, if not
      impossible; and as to prescribing punishment to others, he would almost
      prefer to take it upon himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day he talked these troublesome matters over with his Assistant
      Adjutant-General, and finally requested him to draw up, and submit to him,
      in writing, a plan for governing the city. This he did on the day
      following the request. The leading feature of the plan submitted was to
      organize a provost-court, over which some officer should preside as
      provost-judge, who should hear and adjudicate all cases of whatsoever kind
      brought before him. To arrest delinquents and enforce the orders of the
      provost-court, the plan proposed that the soldiers, detailed for sentinel
      duty in the city, should be organized into a provost-guard, with a
      provost-marshal at their head; that both the marshal and guard should be
      subject to the direct orders of the provost-judge; and that the
      provost-judge should submit his doings, every day, to the military
      governor for his approval, amendment, or reversal, since he alone was
      responsible to the general government for what was done within his
      command. General Montgomery considered the plan carefully and decided to
      adopt it. He then asked his Adjutant to accept the appointment of
      provost-judge, and perform its duties, in addition to such as he had as
      Assistant Adjutant-General of the post. At first the Adjutant declined,
      not seeing how it was possible for him to perform both duties, since
      either one of them seemed quite as much as any one man could perform. The
      General urged that, as he would be held officially responsible for
      whatever the provost-judge might do, he must have some one in whom he had
      implicit confidence, some one whom he could see and converse with at every
      meal-time, some one who was familiar with the workings of courts of
      justice, and since he, the Adjutant, had drawn up the plan, there was no
      one whom he could detail that could put the plan in operation so well as
      he. The Adjutant, on the other hand, urged that his duties were already
      quite as much as he could perform satisfactorily to himself; that almost
      every day he had quartermaster, commissary, and hospital reports to
      examine and sign; passes and permits to consider and issue, etc.; all of
      which involved the writing, "By order of Brigadier-General Montgomery, J.
      R. Freese, A. A. G.," from one hundred to five hundred times each day,
      which usually occupied every minute of his time. It was finally arranged
      that the General should detail two additional clerks for the Adjutant's
      office, and one to write up the records of the court at every sitting, and
      thereupon the Adjutant consented to enter upon the additional duty of
      provost-judge of the city. The General issued the necessary order, over
      his own signature, and on the day following the Adjutant entered upon his
      new duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The court-house had not been used for any purpose since the evacuation of
      the city by the Confederates. Men were now put to work in cleaning and
      fitting it up for the purposes of the new provost-court. A large building
      on the outskirts of the city, which had been used for the temporary
      detention of slaves, and therefore called a "slave-pen," was cleaned and
      fitted up as a guard-house. The old jail was cleaned, whitewashed, and
      renovated generally. A large, empty building, in the heart of the city,
      was fitted up for the provost-marshal's office, and as quarters for the
      guards. Captain Griffiths, of Pennsylvania, the senior captain of the
      companies then on duty as sentinels, was appointed provost-marshal, and
      the two companies then on duty organized as a provost-guard. The duty
      assigned them was to arrest every drunken man&mdash;officer, private, or
      citizen&mdash;whom they observed to be disturbing the peace of the city,
      whether at hotels, drinking saloons, on the streets, or elsewhere; to take
      them, so soon as arrested, to the officer in charge at the guard-house and
      report all the facts to him; if the officer at the guard-house deemed the
      complaint to be of such seriousness as to require a further hearing, the
      arrested party was to be locked up until the next sitting of the
      provost-court, when he was to be brought before that court for trial. This
      was to be the procedure not only in cases of drunkenness, but in all other
      cases of petty misdemeanor. If, however, the offence was of a more serious
      character, the party arrested was to be taken at once before the
      provost-marshal, and all the facts immediately after reported to the
      provost-judge. If he deemed the charges sufficiently strong to hold the
      arrested party, he was then to be sent to the county jail and there held
      until next day, or until the court was ready to try the case, which
      usually was on the day following the arrest. It was arranged that a
      session of the provost-court should be held every day (Sundays excepted)
      at the court-house, commencing at ten o'clock, and continue until all the
      cases were disposed of. Usually this could be done between ten and twelve
      o'clock; but occasionally the sessions extended until late in the
      afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all needed arrangements had been completed, the Judge's horse&mdash;saddled,
      bridled, and with a pair of loaded revolvers in the holsters&mdash;might
      be seen every morning, at precisely nine and a half o'clock, standing
      before the General's headquarters. At precisely a quarter to ten, Judge
      Freese would come out of the Adjutant's office in full uniform, mount his
      horse, and, usually on a full gallop, ride to the court-house, about a
      quarter of a mile distant from the headquarters. On reaching the
      court-house the Judge dismounted, a soldier took charge of his horse, and
      he passed in to take his seat on the bench. Generally, the guards, and the
      prisoners from the guard-house, were already in waiting&mdash;every guard
      standing at attention, with loaded musket and fixed bayonet. It was from
      this fact that it was sometimes designated, by New York journals and
      others, as "Judge Freese's Bayonet Court." The clerk, acting as "crier,"
      then announced that the "court was now open for business," and immediately
      after handed the Judge a list containing the names of all the prisoners at
      the bar, with the nature of the offence charged against each. The Judge,
      beginning with No. I, would call for the evidence of the sentinel making
      the arrest, and then for the evidence of others who might know anything of
      the case. When the evidence for the prosecution had closed, the accused
      was asked to say anything he could in his own defence, and to produce any
      witnesses he might have. It was plainly to be seen that the Judge always
      leaned towards mercy; that he encouraged and aided the prisoner in the
      making of a defence, if any were possible; that never, at any time, did he
      speak harshly to a prisoner at the bar; but even in his sentences so
      tempered his words with kindness and good advice as to make the accused
      determine to do better in the future. At no session of the court, nor at
      any time after, was a prisoner ever known to complain of his treatment by
      the Judge, such was his uniform kindness and courtesy towards all who were
      brought before him, whether citizens or soldiers, white or black. When all
      the evidence was in on both sides, the Judge announced the sentence and
      the clerk recorded it The book in which the record was kept was open to
      the inspection and revision of the General commanding (military governor)
      every day, so that he might, if he chose, at once change or reverse any
      sentence which the Judge had passed upon any prisoner. The number of cases
      tried each day varied from ten to thirty. Most of them were of a minor
      character, and the punishment, consequently, very light Often the one day
      or one night's detention in the guard-house, which they had already
      received, was deemed sufficient; in other more serious cases, a fine of
      from one to five dollars, or further confinement in the guard-house or in
      the jail from one to five days, was imposed; but now and then a case of
      far graver character was brought before the court, one of which we will
      now relate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. A. was an old resident of Alexandria, and for many years had been
      engaged in business as a hardware merchant He was a Virginian by birth; a
      man of general good character, a hearty secessionist, and would have gone
      when the others left, only that his family and his business were in such
      condition that the one could not be removed, nor could the other be closed
      without very great discomfort and a large sacrifice. He therefore
      concluded to take his chances of remaining, and did remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. B. had been a resident of Alexandria for several years. Had been one
      of the builders, and was then superintendent, of the gas-works of that
      city. He was a New Englander by birth, and an earnest Unionist from the
      day the contest opened between the North and the South. Though a very
      quiet man, and never speaking upon political or warlike matters, except
      when in situations where he must speak or show cowardice, yet when thus
      compelled to speak he never failed to express his honest sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Messrs. A. and B. had been warm personal friends for several years, the
      latter purchasing all the hardware needed for the gas-works of the former,
      and being in his store frequently, as well for pastime as on business.
      Until the war commenced there had never been a word of difference between
      them, and since it commenced they had rarely spoken upon the subject, for
      each well knew the others sentiments, and neither desired a rupture of
      friendly relations. On the day in which a rupture did occur, Mr. B. went
      to Mr. A.'s store to make a purchase of some article, when in some way the
      conversation between them turned upon the war. For some cause Mr. A.
      seemed to be in a specially bad-humor that day, and very soon commenced to
      use most violent language toward the "Yankees" and the Union troops. Mr.
      B. replied, at first very mildly, but one word led to another, until
      erelong both became angry and talked loud. All of a sudden Mr. A., who was
      a large, powerful man, seized Mr. B., who was a much smaller, weaker man,
      by the throat, and hurled him to the floor. Then, seizing a large
      butcher-knife which chanced to lay upon the counter, he held it
      threateningly over B.'s breast, and said he would kill him instantly
      unless he would promise not to report the conversation they had had and
      the difficulty following it to Provost-Judge Freese. Of course, such noise
      and confusion brought others into the store, and before the promise could
      be exacted others had seized and dragged Mr. A. from off his prostrate
      antagonist. Mr. B. went from the store direct to military headquarters and
      reported all that had occurred to Judge Freese. A formal statement, as
      detailed by Mr. B., was then drawn up by the Judge and subscribed and
      sworn to by Mr. B. It was then afternoon, and too late to try the case
      that day. The Judge, therefore, issued an order to the Provost-Mar-shal to
      arrest Mr. A. at once, lock him up in the county jail, and bring him
      before the court next morning at ten o'clock&mdash;all of which was done
      precisely as ordered. The arrest of so prominent a man as A. spread
      throughout the city at once. Before sundown there was scarcely a man or a
      woman in the whole city who did not know of it, and General Montgomery was
      besieged by Mr. A.'s wife, by his daughters, and by several of his
      secession friends to order his release at once. The General, having
      learned the facts from his Adjutant, only replied that "things must take
      their course; that the trial, and that only, could develop whether Mr. A.
      was guilty or not, and, if he was, he could not and would not interfere
      with the Judge in the infliction of a proper punishment, however much he
      regretted the difficulty and sympathized with those who were afflicted by
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day the court-room was crowded in every part, and promptly at ten
      o'clock the crier announced the court open for business. After all the
      other cases had been disposed of, that of Mr. A. was called. The
      witnesses, both for the prosecution and for the defence, were examined
      carefully and patiently by the Judge and by the defendant. Then the
      defendant was invited to say whatever he could in his own defence. The
      defendant had a lawyer present to suggest and prompt him, but the lawyer
      would not appear as his formal attorney, for the reason that some time
      before the Judge had announced that, as that was a United States court, no
      lawyer could appear in it, as attorney for another, unless he would take,
      if asked, the oath of allegiance to the United States Government, and the
      lawyer present being an avowed secessionist, he well knew that if he
      attempted to act as an attorney for his friend A., he would at once be
      tendered the oath of allegiance to take or refuse. He therefore contented
      himself with whispering in his friend's ear, without presuming to appear
      as his attorney. The facts, as heretofore stated, were all proved beyond
      any possible doubt. Indeed, the defendant himself scarcely made a denial
      of any one of the statements made by Mr. B. He only pleaded, in
      extenuation, that he had no ill-will towards Mr. B., and that whatever was
      said or done was from an excess of passion for the moment, which he could
      not control; that he greatly regretted all that had happened, and would
      promise the court that the like should never happen again. He also
      produced several witnesses to prove his previous good character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before pronouncing sentence, the Judge took occasion to say that the court
      had been organized for the special purpose of maintaining the peace of the
      city. That, in the absence of all other courts, this was the only judicial
      power to which citizens of Alexandria could look for the protection of
      their lives and their property, and in this respect it was as much of a
      protection to the avowed secessionist as to the Unionist; that the lives
      and the property of the one or of the other were equally under the
      protection of the court. While, he added, the court could not, and would
      not, recognize secession as a legal right, and while no secessionist, as
      such, could have any legal standing in that court, professionally or
      otherwise, yet the court would, at all times and under all circumstances,
      use whatever power it possessed to protect the lives and property of
      avowed secessionists. If, then, it was thus ready to protect secessionists
      in their personal and property rights, certainly it should not be less
      willing to protect Unionists. Nor would it be less ready to protect Union
      men so long as he remained the Judge of the court. In conclusion, the
      Judge said that, in consideration of Mr. A.'s previous good character, in
      the absence of all premeditation, and in consideration of other
      extenuating circumstances surrounding the case, he would make the sentence
      of this defendant very light, but gave fair warning, then and there, to
      all the residents of Alexandria, and to such as came within the
      jurisdiction of the court, though not residents of the city, that should
      there be any further assaults upon Union men, whether by word or by act,
      the court would punish the offender with much greater severity. He then
      sentenced Mr. A. to pay a fine of five hundred dollars, and to stand
      committed to the county jail until the fine was paid. "Of course," the
      Judge added, "this does not relieve Mr. A. from the payment of damages to
      Mr. B. for any injuries he may have sustained at the hands of A., and for
      which he may choose to prosecute in an action for damages." The court then
      adjourned, and Mr. A. was ordered back to the county jail until the fine
      was paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. A. and his friends were very indignant at the sentence; said it should
      never be paid; that he would rot in the jail first; that they would appeal
      to General McClellan, to the President, to the Cabinet, to Congress; but
      to all such threats the Judge only replied, when they came to his ears,
      "He shall have all the opportunities he wants for appeal, but until the
      fine is paid, or the judgment set aside by a higher authority, he must
      remain in jail." That afternoon and evening every possible effort was made
      with General Montgomery and with Judge Freese to have him released on
      bail, but without avail. Next day, when the court opened, a friend of Mr.
      A. was present with five hundred dollars in silver, which he paid down,
      and thereupon received an order from the Judge for Mr. A.'s release from
      jail. That money, as all other received by the court for fines, and not
      used for feeding the prisoners and other incidental court expenses, was
      deposited with the United States Treasurer, at Washington, to await such
      further action as might be had in this or in any other case.
    </p>
    <p>
      In pursuance of their threats, Mr. A. and his friends at once went to work
      to have the fine refunded, and finally, after several months' effort,
      succeeded in getting General McClellan to issue an order on General
      Montgomery for the refunding of the money. This was done by an order on
      the United States Treasurer for the five hundred dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. A. got his money back, but neither he nor any other secessionist of
      Alexandria ever again made an assault, with threat to kill, upon a Union
      man; nor did any Union man make a like assault or threat upon a
      secessionist. And, better still, it had the effect to convince every
      secessionist that Judge Freese's court was no respecter of persons; that
      while it punished such of the poor as violated the law, it was no less
      ready to punish the rich; and that a Union man in Alexandria would be
      protected by the court with as much vigilance as one could possibly be in
      New York or Philadelphia. The refunding of the fine, however, proved that
      General McClellan and his advisers, while pretending great love for the
      Union, were largely in sympathy with the secessionists, and would, so far
      as they could, undo anything the Provost-Court might do in punishing
      rebels and protecting loyal men. General Montgomery and Judge Freese,
      being convinced that such would thenceforth be the policy of General
      McClellan and his advisers, tried thereafter to so shape the proceedings
      of the court that General McClellan should know as little about it, and
      have as little to do with it, as possible&mdash;believing (as afterwards
      proved true) that he would not only thwart its proceedings, but really
      abolish the court altogether, whenever he could see that he could do so
      without calling down upon himself and political associates condemnation
      from the administration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus has been stated the how and why of the organization of the
      Provost-Court at Alexandria; some of the details of its workings, so far
      as appertained to its municipal or police duties; its happy effect upon
      the comparative quiet of the city; and its restraining power on the
      belligerent disposition of some of its citizens. What other powers the
      court was called upon to exercise, and how it exercised them, will be
      reserved for future chapters.

      CHAPTER XII. JUDGE FREESE'S "BAYONET COURT" OTHER POWERS, AND HOW
    </h2>
    <h3>
      EXERCISED.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>ARDLY had the
      Provost-Court at Alexandria been organized before reporters for Northern
      journals began to call upon the General and upon the Judge for details of
      its doings, and soon thereafter reports, to a slight extent, of its
      operations began to appear in some journals under the caption of Judge
      Freese's "Bayonet Court"&mdash;the same as placed at the head of this
      chapter. One illustrated paper of New York city had a full-page cut,
      representing the Judge upon the bench in military uniform, with his clerk
      sitting at his right, and his sword laying upon the desk at his left, with
      guards standing at attention, each with musket and fixed bayonet; with a
      score or more of prisoners in the dock, all with woebegone faces; with the
      Provost-Marshal, in full uniform, standing in front of the Judge, awaiting
      his orders; with lookers-on all about; and with all the other
      paraphernalia of a crowded city court-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not for show, by any means, that the Judge rode to the court in
      uniform, with loaded revolvers in his holsters; nor was it for show that
      he sat upon the bench in uniform, and had guards about him with loaded
      muskets and fixed bayonets. Almost from the day that the court commenced
      its sittings, the secessionists who remained in Alexandria began to sneer
      at the court, and some even went so far as to threaten the Judge with
      assassination.
    </p>
    <p>
      These facts were communicated to the Judge by friends, and through secret
      detectives, whom the Provost-Marshal had employed to watch every movement
      in the city. It was, therefore, literally true that the Judge "carried his
      life in his hand" every moment, and was liable to assault and attempted
      assassination every time he rode to the court-room, every time he took his
      seat upon the bench, every time he walked the streets. But a still greater
      reason for this display of power, and of constant readiness to meet every
      emergency, was, that the inhabitants of the city might be impressed with
      the power of the court, and the source from which it derived that power&mdash;namely,
      the military. Without such impression of power among the citizens, the
      orders of the court would not have been respected and obeyed, and twice,
      if not four times, the number of guards would have been needed to enforce
      its orders and maintain quiet in the city. To relate a few of the cases
      which came before the court, under this particular head, will better
      illustrate the facts above stated than any amount of theorizing.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, the General informed the Judge that, as he was passing along King
      Street, two females, dressed as ladies, overtook and passed him, and, as
      they passed, they gathered up their skirts and held them from him, and
      made other signs of derision and contempt, as though he, the General, was
      the vilest of all vile creatures. After they had passed, he inquired of a
      citizen and learned that they were the wives of two noted secessionists,
      who still remained in the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the same time several officers, and quite a number of the guards,
      told the Judge that, while the men of the city treated them with entire
      respect, the women and the children of secession citizens insulted them
      almost daily&mdash;the women by various acts of contempt, and the children
      by calling them vile names and throwing stones at them. They had borne,
      they said, these things a long time without seeming to notice them, and
      without complaint; but the longer and more they forbore, the oftener and
      viler became the insults, and they could stand it no longer without making
      complaint to the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge thereupon announced in open court, that from thenceforth any
      woman, or any child, who offered an insult, or threw a stone or other
      missile at any officer or soldier upon the public streets, should be
      promptly arrested and inquired of as to who was their husband, father,
      brother, or other near male relative. That, if the guard making the arrest
      was not entirely satisfied as to the truthfulness of the answers made, the
      woman or child should be at once brought to the office of the
      Provost-Marshal or of the Judge, for such further questioning and
      disposition as either might deem proper in the case. That, upon
      ascertaining, without doubt, the name and whereabouts of the husband,
      father, or brother, the woman or child should be dismissed, and the
      husband, father, or brother of the one offending should be immediately
      arrested, locked up in jail until next day, and then brought before the
      court for trial and sentence. Or, if the woman arrested proved to be a
      courtesan, or, if the child had no father or adult brother who could
      answer for him or her, then the woman herself, or the child, should be
      locked up in jail until the next day, and then brought before the court
      for trial and sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within twenty-four hours after this order was promulgated from the bench,
      it was known to every man, woman, and half-grown child of the city. Of
      course, there were deep mutterings, some cursing, and not a few threats,
      especially against Judge Freese, but the effect was wonderful and
      immediate. So wholesome a dread did it produce on the minds of those who
      had been offering such insults, daily, and almost every hour of the day,
      that there was only one instance in which the order had to be executed.
      That was the case of a child, who called vile names and threw stones at
      one of the guards, while at his post. The child was promptly arrested, the
      name of his father ascertained, the child dismissed, and the father at
      once arrested and locked up until next day. When brought before the court,
      the father proved one of the most pronounced secessionists of the city,
      and, instead of apologizing for the rude acts of his son, rather approved
      of what he had done. The Judge tried to reason with him as to the
      impropriety of such conduct towards any one, and especially towards a
      guard, whose duty and business it was to protect the lives and property of
      secessionists no less than of Unionists. But the longer the Judge
      reasoned, the more obstinate the defendant became, until finally the Judge
      said he would have to make a slight example in his case, and thereupon
      sentenced him to ten days in the county jail&mdash;promising that the next
      person arrested for a like offence should receive a sentence doubly, if
      not quadruply, as great. The news of the arrest and sentence was speedily
      known in every house of the city, and from thenceforth no other arrest was
      necessary for a like offence. The recognized power of the court had done
      the work, with but one arrest and punishment as an example. But for this
      recognized power, at least a hundred arrests would have been needed before
      the evil could have been abated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another instance of the recognition of the power of the court was as
      follows: One of the Episcopal ministers of the city was known to be in the
      habit of omitting the prayer for the President of the United States, found
      in the morning service of the Episcopal prayer-book. The fact was told to
      the Provost-judge, and he was asked by some over-zealous Unionists to send
      a note to the minister, requiring him to use the prayer, or be subject to
      arrest in case he refused. The Judge declined to do any such thing&mdash;telling
      his informants, that whether the minister used that prayer or not was
      purely a matter of conscience, and that it was no part of his business, or
      the business of his court, to interfere in matters of conscience; that he
      fully agreed with Roger Williams in the opinion, that the civil or
      military authorities of a town, city, or state, "have no more right to
      command over the souls and consciences of their subjects than the master
      of a ship has over those of his passengers or the sailors under him,
      although he may justly see to the labor of the one, and the civil behavior
      of all in the ship;" that so long as the Episcopal minister, and those who
      attended his church, deported themselves as quiet citizens, attending to
      their own affairs and not interfering with the affairs of others, no
      matter what might be their sentiments on religious or political affairs,
      they were entitled to protection in their persons and property, and should
      have it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who reported the minister and desired his arrest were not at all
      pleased with Judge Freese's reply, and tried hard to get up some feeling
      against him among the Union men of the city; but utterly failed in the
      attempt. The Judge's Union sentiments were too well known, and had been
      too often tested, to allow any one who knew him to doubt him for a moment.
      Failing to make any impression against the Judge among the Union men of
      the city, these over-zealous busybodies next tried their hands among the
      officers of troops which lay about the city. It chanced, just at that
      time, that a regiment of Illinois cavalry was encamped on the outskirts of
      the city, whose officers were known to be among the most violent
      abolitionists of the country; men who believed, or pretended to believe,
      that no man who lived in a slave State had any rights which a Union man
      was bound to respect&mdash;not even the right of conscience. To these
      officers these busybodies told the story about the Episcopal minister
      omitting the prayer for the President in the morning service of the
      prayer-book; and also of their having told the whole thing to Judge
      Freese, and of his refusing to issue an order to the minister to use the
      prayer or be subject to arrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of their listeners, the Lieutenant-Colonel of the regiment, became so
      interested in their story as to volunteer at once to bring the recusant
      minister to speedy justice; nor did he care "a snap of his finger for
      Judge Freese, or for any other judge." Several other officers of the
      regiment volunteered to join him, and the plan agreed upon was that, on
      the following Sabbath, they would all attend the Episcopal service, and
      when the Rev. Doctor came to the part where the prayer for the President
      occurs, in the "morning service," if he failed to read it, the
      Lieutenant-Colonel would arise in his seat and demand that it be read, and
      if the minister refused, then to arrest him, and take him to the general
      headquarters. According to appointment, the Lieutenant-Colonel and his
      friends were at the church on the following Sabbath morning. The
      congregation was not large, but those present seemed to be unusually
      devout. The sexton had given the Lieutenant-Colonel and his friends seats
      in about the centre of the church. The service was opened in the usual
      form. The "general confession" had been repeated, all kneeling; the
      "declaration of absolution" had been pronounced; the Lord's prayer said in
      a clear but subdued voice; the "<i>Venite Exultemus Domino</i>" had been
      sung by the choir; the portion of the Psalms appointed for the day read;
      the "<i>Te Deum Laudamus</i>" sung; the lesson from the New Testament,
      according to the calendar, read; the Apostles' Creed repeated; and the
      prayers were being read, when, all of a sudden, a stentorian voice was
      heard, saying, "I demand, sir, that you read the prayer for the President
      of the United States." Had a cannon-ball burst through the walls of the
      church and fallen upon the floor just at that instant, greater surprise
      would not have been created. For a moment the minister stopped in his
      prayers. Part of the congregation arose from their knees to their feet and
      looked wildly around. Some of the more nervous of the ladies burst into
      tears. Confusion worse confounded seemed to pervade the whole
      congregation. So soon as the minister recovered self-possession, he
      commenced to read the prayer "for the clergy and people," when again a
      voice, louder than before, sounded throughout the church, saying, "I
      demand, sir, that you read the prayer for the President of the United
      States." Again the minister stopped, and again confusion prevailed for
      some moments. When quiet again prevailed, the minister, without having
      made any answer whatever to the two former requests, commenced to read the
      prayer for "all conditions of men," when again the demand to read the
      prayer for the President was repeated in a still louder and more
      threatening tone. The minister then arose from his knees, and, looking
      towards the Lieutenant-Colonel, said, "My conscience will not allow me, at
      this time, to read that prayer, and the congregation who statedly worship
      in this church have requested that I should not read it while the war
      between the North and the South continues."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, sir, you shall read no others while the war continues, and I now
      arrest you on the charge of treason," said the Lieutenant-Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, of course, still further increased the astonishment and confusion of
      the congregation. For a few moments every one seemed utterly dumbfounded.
      Meanwhile the Lieutenant-Colonel and his party left their seats, advanced
      near the altar, and told the minister he must accompany them to the
      general headquarters. The minister asked whether he might not first go to
      the vestry-room to lay aside his surplice and gown. The Lieutenant-Colonel
      answered, "No; come as you are." He then came out from the chancel, joined
      his arresters, and, in full canonicals, without hat or cap, marched with
      them through the streets, several squares, to the general headquarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this had been done without any knowledge whatever on the part of
      General Montgomery or Judge Freese, nor could any two have been more
      astonished than they were on seeing the minister and hearing the story of
      his arrest. The General was annoyed beyond measure, and, for a time,
      hardly knew what to say or to do. The Judge was decidedly more
      self-possessed, but, of course, said nothing. The General, turning to the
      Judge, asked him if he had heard anything of the case before. The Judge
      then told the General all that he had known, and all that he had said
      about it, as has been heretofore detailed. As he, the Judge, had done
      nothing, and had refused to do anything, concerning it, of course he had
      made no report of it to the General, since there was nothing to report.
      The General, turning to the Lieutenant-Colonel and his party, said that he
      entirely agreed in sentiment with his Assistant Adjutant-General; that
      there was no reason, not the slightest, for the arrest of this minister;
      that every officer engaged in the arrest had made himself liable to be put
      in arrest, and tried by court-martial, for doing that which he had no
      right to do as a military man; and that the minister, upon complaint to
      the Provost-Judge, might have every one of them arrested and tried by the
      Provost-Court for assault and for a disturbance of public services. In
      conclusion, the General discharged the minister from arrest and told him
      that he might go to his own home, when, turning to the cavalry officers,
      he said, "The sooner you can get back to your own quarters, and the closer
      you remain there hereafter, the better will it be for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      As might have been expected, all this created a great amount of excitement
      on the streets and about the headquarters. The minister in his white
      robes, in charge of several officers in full uniform, and with the entire
      congregation following after, was such a sight as had never been seen in
      Alexandria before. Everybody&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;who saw
      it, followed after, until, when the headquarters were reached, there were
      several hundred persons present. When the General's decision in the case
      became known to the crowd, there was a general approval, as much among
      Unionists as among secessionists; but to this there were some exceptions.
      The officers and their informers, who had been balked in their mad
      purposes, felt chagrined and angry, and left the headquarters with
      scowling faces, as though still bent on mischief. The General and the
      Judge went to their private quarters, in a building across the street,
      nearly opposite to the general headquarters. They supposed the trouble
      ended, and that they should hear nothing more of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In about an hour thereafter, when the General and the Judge had just risen
      from their mess-table, an orderly came rushing into their quarters, to say
      that a large crowd of cavalry officers, soldiers, and citizens were
      gathered about the Episcopal church, on E Street (the one in which the
      minister had been arrested), and that they were threatening to burn it.
      The General at once buckled on his sword, and told his Adjutant to do the
      same. Both put their revolvers in their belts. The Judge then told the
      orderly to hasten to the Provost-Marshal's office, and tell him to come
      himself, and bring as many officers and men with him as possible to the
      Episcopal church on E Street,'and there await further orders from the
      General or himself. The General and the Judge then went to the church in
      all possible haste, and found, as had been told them, several hundred
      soldiers and citizens gathered about it. In a little while after, the
      Provost-Marshal, with a considerable number of his guard, appeared on the
      ground. "Burn it! burn it! burn it!" with intermingling oaths, could be
      heard every now and then from the mouths of half-crazed cavalry soldiers.
      The General and the Judge worked their way through the crowd, and took
      their stations directly in front of the church. The Provost-Marshal and
      his guard also worked their way through the crowd to the same place. The
      General then told the Judge to command the peace, in as loud a voice as he
      could. The Judge did so, and then added, "If any one attempts to set fire
      to this church, he will be shot down at once&mdash;and all persons,
      whether soldiers or citizens, who are found within five hundred yards of
      this church building after thirty minutes shall have expired, will be
      arrested by the provost-guard, put in jail until to-morrow, and then
      brought before the Provost-Court for disturbing the peace and violating
      the sanctity of the Sabbath." Scarcely had the Judge finished his
      proclamation, before the crowd commenced to move off, and before the
      thirty minutes had expired not a soldier or citizen could be seen on the
      street, save the General and his party. Guards were then stationed at
      every approach to the church, with orders that they should be regularly
      relieved and the stations maintained until otherwise ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no other attempt to set fire to that church, nor to any other in
      Alexandria, after that, so long as "Judge Freese's bayonet court"
      continued to have an existence&mdash;nor could there have been a more
      signal instance to exemplify the acknowledged power of the court than the
      one just related. The cavalry regiment spoken of numbered over one
      thousand officers and men, nearly every one of whom held sentiments much
      the same, if not precisely the same, as the Lieutenant-Colonel. Within a
      circle of a few miles were dozens of other regiments, nearly all of whom
      held similar sentiments. Had that one church been burned on that day,
      probably every other church and two-thirds of all the buildings in the
      city would have been burned during the following thirty days. To prevent
      that church from being burned, there were present not more than fifty
      officers and men, as against at least one thousand of an opposite
      sentiment. In physical power the one was as nothing to the other; but,
      after the Judge had finished his announcement, there was not one of the
      thousand who stopped for a moment to question the power of which the Judge
      was the representative. Had a like power existed, and had a like power
      been exercised in other cities of the South occupied by Union troops, how
      many millions upon millions of dollars' worth of property might have been
      saved from the flames!
    </p>
    <p>
      We will give only one other instance under this head, though, if time and
      space permitted, it would be easy to give scores.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. D. lived upon one of the most fashionable streets of Alexandria, and
      his family had long been regarded as among the F. F. V.'s of the State. He
      owned lands in other parts of Virginia on which he had a large number of
      slaves, and always kept a few at his Alexandria residence to wait upon his
      family. For some cause Mr. D. did not leave Alexandria when other
      secessionists left, though he took the precaution to send all his slaves
      away except two, both females&mdash;mother and daughter&mdash;the one
      about forty, the other about twenty years of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. H. lived next door to Mr. D., and though a Northern man by birth, had
      long been a resident and merchant of Alexandria. He had always been
      conscientiously opposed to owning slaves, though he had hired them of
      others as family servants ever since his residence in the city. The
      families of Messrs. D. and H. had long been on the most friendly terms,
      and continued so, notwithstanding the war, up to the very day on which the
      incident occurred which we are now about to relate.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some weeks previous to this day, Mrs. H. had occasionally heard
      terrible, unearthly screams next door, and had wondered again and again
      what on earth it could mean. She had mentioned the fact to her husband,
      and he had suggested that it was probably the cry of servants being
      punished; but being upon the most friendly terms, as before stated, with
      their neighbors, they could not, and did not, say a word about it to
      others. Thus matters went on until the day in question. Again Mrs. H.
      heard the same fearful, heart-rending cries, and they continued on and on
      until her very heart grew sick and faint. Just then she heard some one
      calling her name loudly from the back yard of the next building, and,
      stepping to the window, saw the elder of Mrs. D.'s two servants wringing
      her hands and crying out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, come, Mrs. H., come quickly! come quickly! They are killing my child!
      they are killing my child!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tears were pouring in a stream from the poor mothers eyes, and it seemed
      as though her very heart would break from anguish. Mrs. H. could stand it
      no longer, and stepping out on her own back porch, which adjoined that of
      Mrs. D.'s, called out for Mrs. D., and when she appeared, asked her what
      was the cause of such awful screaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nothing, nothing," answered Mrs. D. "It's only Jane, whom Mr. D. is
      punishing for looking out of the windows at the soldiers as they pass. I
      have told her again and again that she should not do it, and yet she will
      persist in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said Mrs. H., "was that all? Surely a young girl like her could
      hardly do otherwise than look out of the windows when she heard music and
      saw soldiers passing? Did she do nothing else, Mrs. D.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, nothing else," answered Mrs. D.; "but Mr. D. says if she and her
      mother are allowed to look out of the windows at the soldiers, they will
      soon be wanting to run away, and therefore we must not allow them to look
      out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They don't neglect their work, do they, Mrs. D.?" asked Mrs. H.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no," answered Mrs. D. "They are both most excellent servants, and
      never neglect their work; but hav-ing these Yankee soldiers in the city
      will, we fear, make them want to run away, and it is only to prevent them
      from getting any such foolish notion in their heads that we have forbid
      them to look out at the windows."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you had to punish them often for disobeying the order?" asked Mrs.
      H.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, not often," answered Mrs. D. "This is only the fifth time, I
      think, that Mr. D. has had to whip Jane since the Yankee soldiers came
      into the city, and her mother has only needed three punishments for the
      same offence. Take them all in all, there are, I think, few better
      servants in Alexandria than Jane and Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      This ended the conversation between the two ladies at that time, and Mrs.
      H. returned to her own parlors a sadder, if not a wiser, woman. Within a
      half hour Mrs. H. heard still louder and more piercing cries, and the
      voice this time was plainly that of Jane's mother. Stepping to and opening
      one of her back parlor-windows, she could distinctly hear the conversation
      between Mr. D. and Mary, which seemed to come from the garret of the
      house, the back dormer-windows of which chanced to be open.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't kill me, Mr. D., don't kill me! I only called Mrs. H. because I
      thought you was killing my child&mdash;she screamed so terribly! Oh,
      please don't whip me any more this time, please! My back is still sore
      from the last whipping you gave me, and every stroke you now give me seems
      to cut into the flesh like a knife. Oh, please don't whip me any more!
      please don't! please! please!"
    </p>
    <p>
      These words from Mary's lips Mrs. H. distinguished as plainly as though
      they had been spoken at her side, for both Jane and her mother spoke most
      excellent English, having always been brought up as house servants, and
      never having imbibed the habit of using the negro dialect. Indeed, in
      their habits and manners they were quite as ladylike as their mistress,
      nor could it hardly be otherwise, since both from childhood had been made
      to wait upon ladies of education and refinement, and could scarcely have
      failed to imbibe their language and manners. Pathetic as Mary's pleadings
      were, however, they failed to reach Mr. D.'s heart, for in a moment after
      Mrs. H. heard the lash again applied, and this time Mary screamed still
      louder than before. Again and again she could hear the lash descend upon
      poor Mary's back, and again and again came from her lips the most horrid
      screechings and the most piteous moans. Finally, Mrs. H. could listen no
      longer, but, returning to her sitting-room, threw herself upon a lounge
      and wept as if her very heart would break. Then and there she made a most
      solemn vow to God that she would give herself no rest until she had
      rescued Jane and her mother from their heartless, cruel master, nor would
      she ever try again to live on terms of friendship, much less of intimacy,
      with Mr. and Mrs. D.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. H. came home to tea, he observed that his wife had been weeping,
      and inquired the cause. She then told him all that she had seen and heard
      during the afternoon, and begged of him, for her sake, for Mary and Jane's
      sake, for God's sake, to go, immediately after tea, to Judge Freese's
      quarters and tell him all that had occurred. She was sure, she said, from
      what she had heard of his court, that he would not permit such heartless
      barbarities to continue in Alexandria. The husband was deeply impressed
      with his wife's story, and still more so by the pathetic appeal which she
      had made to him in behalf of the two servants, and promised to do as she
      requested, notwithstanding his very great reluctance to break friendship
      with Mr. and Mrs. D.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, after tea, instead of going back to his store he went direct
      to Judge Freese's quarters and told him the whole story, just as his wife
      had told it to him. The Judge listened attentively, and, when Mr. H. had
      finished, said, in a very quiet but in a very determined way, that the
      case should have his careful and prompt attention. The Judge then told Mr.
      H. to please bring his wife around to headquarters next morning, that she
      might make a formal affidavit to what she had seen and heard, after
      receiving which he would direct the Provost-Mar-shal to arrest Mr. H., and
      bring him and the two servants before the court at its next sitting. Next
      morning early Mr. and Mrs. H. went to the general headquarters. The Judge
      wrote down, as Mrs. H. detailed it, the story as heretofore told, when
      Mrs. H. added her signature and made affidavit as to its truthfulness. The
      Judge then sent for the Provost-Marshal, and ordered him to arrest Mr. D.
      and bring him and the two servants, Mary and Jane, before the court at ten
      o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrest of so prominent a citizen as Mr. D. spread through the city
      like wildfire, and, when the court assembled, the court-room was crowded
      in every part. After all the other prisoners present had been discharged
      or sentenced, the case of Mr. H. was called. He arose, when his name was
      called, and said he was there in obedience to the orders of the court, but
      for what cause he knew not, except&mdash;if he had understood the marshal
      aright&mdash;for punishing his own slaves, which, according to the laws of
      Virginia, he certainly had the right to do. The Judge only replied that he
      (Mr. D.) would probably understand his rights better after the case had
      been tried, and then directed that the trial proceed. Mr. D. asked if he
      could be represented by an attorney.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," replied the Judge, "if the attorney will first take the oath
      of allegiance to the United States Government."
    </p>
    <p>
      This the attorney present declined to do, and Mr. D. was obliged to act as
      his own attorney. The first witness called was Mary, the slave-mother. She
      testified, in response to questions by the court, that she had been born
      the slave of Mrs. D.'s father, and had lived in his family until Mrs. D.
      was married, when she had been given to Mrs. D. as her maid or
      body-servant; that her daughter Jane, then about five years of age, had
      been given to Mrs. D. at the same time; that she, Mary, had never been
      married, but when less than twenty years of age had repeatedly been
      ordered to the bedchamber of Mrs. D.'s father; that Jane was none other
      than the daughter of Mrs. D.'s own father, and consequently half-sister to
      Mrs. D. herself; that she had frequently asked her former master and her
      present mistress for the privilege to learn to read and write, and, when
      she had learned herself, that she might teach her daughter Jane, but they
      had always refused, and given as a reason that the laws of Virginia made
      it a criminal offence to teach a slave to read or write; that both she and
      her daughter had been generally well treated by Mr. and Mrs. D. until the
      Union troops came to Alexandria; that since that time both seemed to have
      entirely changed in their disposition towards her and her daughter; that
      nothing they could do seemed to please them; that both she and her
      daughter had been forbidden to go upon the street at any time or upon any
      occasion, and that finally they had been forbidden to look out of the
      windows; that they had tried to obey even this order, but, on hearing
      music and the tramp of passing soldiers, they had sometimes been drawn to
      the windows unthinkingly; for this one offence and for no other&mdash;for
      Mrs. D. always reported them to her husband, and seemed to take pleasure
      in doing so whenever she chanced to catch them at a window&mdash;Mr. D.
      had whipped both her and her daughter several times most terribly; that he
      always took them to the garret, tied a cord around each wrist, threw the
      cord over a beam and drew them up until their toes just touched the floor,
      stripped them to the waist, and then with a rawhide gave them as many
      lashes as he thought they could stand without fainting; that her own back,
      and her daughter's as well, were so raw and sore that they could hardly
      wear their dresses; that Mrs. D. always encouraged these whippings, and
      that neither she nor her husband ever manifested the least sympathy with
      their subsequent sufferings; that neither she nor her daughter had ever
      made an attempt to escape from bondage, nor had either of them ever
      threatened their master or mistress so to do, notwithstanding all they had
      suffered. She wept frequently while giving in her testimony, and at times
      almost the entire audience seemed melted to tears. The Judge was observed
      to wipe his eyes frequently, and several times his voice was so choked
      with emotion that he had to hesitate some moments before he could put the
      next question. The whole of Mary's evidence had to be drawn from her lips,
      item by item. She seemed all the while afraid to answer questions, and
      said nothing of her own accord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane was next called. Her evidence entirely accorded with her mother's, so
      far as her knowledge extended. Mrs. D., she said, had never found any
      fault about her work&mdash;only about her looking out of the windows, and
      this she had not meant to do, but did it every time without thinking. When
      she heard the music of a band, or the tramp of soldiers, some <i>irresistible
      force</i> always drew her to the nearest window to look out. She could not
      help it, though her life depended upon it. Both she and her mother were
      passionately fond of music, and when their mistress played on the piano in
      the parlor, they generally managed to leave their work long enough to
      stand and listen, by a door ajar, until the music ended. She did not
      understand why she and her mother should be so infatuated&mdash;crazy as
      she called it&mdash;about music. She only knew that it was so, and that
      neither of them could help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. H. was the next witness. She detailed, carefully and succinctly, what
      she had heard and seen the afternoon before. Told of her long and
      agreeable acquaintance with Mr. and Mrs. D., and how much she regretted
      the rupture of those friendly relations. Said she had frequently heard
      Mrs. D. speak in the highest terms of her two servants, Mary and Jane;
      that several times before that afternoon she had heard strange, unusual
      noises next door, but never until then had she heard them plain enough to
      know what they meant. On leaving the witness-stand and resuming her seat,
      she burst into a flood of tears, and it was several minutes before she
      could regain her self-possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge then asked Mr. D. to call any witnesses he had present, or to
      present himself or his wife as a witness, if he thought proper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. D. replied that he had no witnesses in the case, neither did he
      propose to offer himself nor his wife as a witness; that he substantially
      admitted all that had been said by the witnesses for the prosecution,
      except as to the severity of the punishment inflicted. In that, he
      thought, the witnesses had all exaggerated. In the excitement attendant
      upon the punishment of a servant, however, one might strike harder blows,
      and more of them, than he intended or knew of at the moment; but he
      certainly never had intended to punish either Mary or Jane to the extent
      they had described. His defence, he said, was that he had done nothing
      more than the laws of Virginia authorized. That, within maiming and death,
      the law gave to a master the authority to punish a slave to any extent he
      pleased. That ever since Federal troops had been in the city he had
      suspected Mary and Jane to be planning means of escape, and that it was to
      make them realize his right to them as their owner and master, and to keep
      them in wholesome dread of his authority, that he had forbidden them to go
      upon the streets, to look out at the windows, and had occasionally
      punished them in, as he thought, a very mild way. Besides, he thought a
      military court had no right whatever to interfere with the relations
      between master and slave, and hoped the court would think proper to
      dismiss the case. He spoke in a very pompous manner, and took his seat as
      one who had entirely demolished his adversaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments there was an almost death-like silence in the
      court-room. No one spoke. You could almost have heard a pin drop on the
      floor. The Judge then ordered Mr. D. to stand up to receive the sentence
      of the court. Mr. D. stood up. The Judge then proceeded to say, "Sir: You
      are charged with assault and battery upon these two defenceless females,
      Mary and Jane. The evidence is clear that you committed such assault, not
      once only but several times. Indeed, you yourself admit it. Your defence
      is that they are your slaves, and that, according to the slave code of
      Virginia, you had the right to punish them to any extent you pleased
      within that of maiming or the taking of life. I am not familiar with the
      slave code of Virginia, and cannot say of a certainty that you represent
      it wrongfully, but I can say that if such authority exists upon any
      statute-book of any State, it is a disgrace to civilization, and the
      sooner it be expunged the better. But, sir, it matters not to this court
      what the laws of Virginia may be upon this or upon any other subject. This
      is a United States military court&mdash;a court of necessity, and
      'necessity knows no law' is an old maxim&mdash;a court established because
      all other means of justice had fled from this city&mdash;a court governed
      by the principles of equity, rather than of law&mdash;a court established
      to protect the lives, the natural rights, and the property of every
      inhabitant of Alexandria, without regard to their political opinions,
      their religious predilections, their sex, their condition in life, or
      their color&mdash;a court which does not, and cannot, recognize slavery in
      any shape or form&mdash;a court which now and ever will protect the lives,
      the personal rights, and the property of those called slaves as readily as
      of those called masters. While this court possesses no power to dissolve
      the relation which the laws of a State have made possible between master
      and slave&mdash;that power belonging alone to the President of the United
      States in his capacity as commander-in-chief of the army and navy&mdash;yet
      it does possess the power, and it is its imperative duty, to protect the
      weak against the strong, the slave against undue severity from his or her
      master or mistress, and particularly from inflicting punishment without
      adequate cause. The evidence in this case, sir, shows that you had no
      cause, no reasonable cause, for inflicting any punishment whatever on
      either of these females; that they were both uniformly good servants, that
      your wife invariably spoke of them as such until the Union troops came
      into this city, and that then, and not till then, you conceived the idea
      that they would escape from your service if they could, and to counteract
      such a thought in their minds you gave them commands contrary to all the
      laws of nature; and because they did not, for the reason that they could
      not, obey these unnatural commands, you inflicted upon them both a degree
      of punishment such as a man would be indictable for if inflicted upon a
      horse. This you try to excuse by saying that, while in a passion, you may
      have struck them harder and oftener than you intended; the answer to which
      is that a man subject to such violent passions, and devoid of mercy, as
      you, sir, appear to be, is utterly unfit to have in his power those who
      are unable to defend themselves against brute violence. Those whom you
      abuse, therefore, must be taken from your control; must be placed in the
      hands of those who will treat them kindly, treat them as human beings; and
      though this temporary taking away may not destroy your legal right to
      their services at some future time, it will, at least, protect them from
      your violence for the present, and it may be that, before this sentence
      shall have expired, a merciful Providence may induce the President to
      issue a proclamation of universal freedom to all the slaves of this land.
      Meanwhile, this court will use all the power it possesses to protect them
      from undue violence from those who call themselves their owners; and the
      court desires to give fair warning now, so that all may be without excuse
      hereafter, that from henceforth this court will regard an assault made
      upon a so-called slave in precisely the same light as if made upon a free
      white person. For every stroke laid, upon a slave hereafter, without
      justifiable cause, the master will receive a like number, or other
      punishment equal thereto, by the sentence of this court; and the only
      reason why you, sir, are excused from corporal punishment now, is, that
      you acted ignorantly&mdash;acted, as you supposed, under the laws of
      Virginia, and without knowing the law or orders of this court upon this
      subject. Hereafter no one within the jurisdiction of this court can have
      any such excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sentence of the court is, that you, Mr. D., immediately after the
      adjournment of this court, go with the Provost-Marshal to his office, and
      there, over your own hand and seal, with the Provost-Marshal as a witness,
      execute a permit to Mary and to Jane, each, to leave your employ at once,
      and take with them whatever of clothing or other articles heretofore
      recognized as theirs&mdash;to engage their services as domestics to
      whomsoever else they please, to receive in their own right and to use as
      they please, whatever wages may be agreed upon between them and their
      future employers&mdash;to go and come when and wheresoever they please,
      and in no respect whatsoever to be subject to your direction or control.
      And the further judgment of the court is, that this sentence shall remain
      in full force and virtue so long as the war between the North and the
      South continues.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To you, Mr. Provost-Marshal, the court begs to say that you will not
      permit Mr. D. to leave your custody until he has fully executed this
      order; and should he refuse, or even hesitate, you will at once lock him
      up in the county jail, and report to this court for further orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To you, Mr. and Mrs. H., the court begs to return not only its thanks,
      but the thanks of every peace-loving, mercy-loving, freedom-loving citizen
      of this community, for having brought this case before the court, and
      thereby put a check, if not an entire stop, to an evil which otherwise
      might have grown to huge proportions; and, as a further manifestation of
      your good hearts, the court requests that you will take Mary and her
      daughter in your own employ, until such time as a better arrangement can
      be effected, if that be ever possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The court stands adjourned until to-morrow at ten o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Judge was delivering this sentence, perfect silence prevailed;
      but the moment he closed, a buzz of approval ran throughout the
      court-room, amounting almost to cheers. Mr. D. and his attorney, and the
      few friends immediately about him, looked like so many dark thunder-clouds
      in a clear sky; but the contrast only made the sky to appear the brighter.
      The crowd dispersed. The sentinels present, at a shoulder-arms, with fixed
      bayonets, at once formed a front and rear guard to the Provost-Marshal and
      his prisoner, and, when on the street, a hollow-square, until they reached
      the Provost Marshal's office. A permit, such as the court had directed,
      was then prepared, to which Mr. D. put his hand and seal, with the
      Provost-Marshal as a witness. The Provost-Marshal then went with Mary and
      her daughter (Mr. D. still accompanying and not yet discharged) to Mr.
      D.'s house, where the two servants were permitted to gather together their
      clothing and whatever else they claimed as theirs. Mrs. D. was at first
      disposed to refuse the servants their clothing, or anything else, and to
      talk loudly against the injustice of the court, etc.; but a word of
      caution from the Provost-Marshal, and a beseeching look from her husband,
      effectually closed her lips. When Mary and Jane had got all together, in
      such bundle as they could easily carry, the Marshal accompanied them to
      the residence of Mrs. H. and there left them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. H. met them in the entry-way, and the moment they saw her, both
      servants fell on their knees and begged to kiss her hand, or even the hem
      of her garment. They wept and laughed alternately, and it was some time
      before she could get them to arise from their knees and go to the room
      which had been prepared for them. The transition from slavery to virtual
      freedom, from constant dread to free volition, to what had seemed to them
      a hell to what now seemed to them a heaven, had been so sudden, that they
      could scarcely realize it as possible; and, when they reached the room
      assigned them, both again fell on their knees, and for a full hour
      returned thanks to God for his mercy and loving-kindness, and implored
      blessings on those who had shown them such unexpected kindness. Both Mary
      and her daughter were members of the Methodist Church&mdash;the former had
      been so for many years&mdash;and both had always led, so far as was known,
      consistent Christian lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of the trial was soon in the mouths of everybody, some
      condemning, but a large majority approving. The effect was, that not a
      single similar case was brought before the court after that. The warning
      of the court was so plain and pointed that all who owned slaves in
      Alexandria felt that they knew, as well before as after, what punishment
      would follow ill-treatment, and none were ill-treated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had like courts followed the army, or been established in every city of
      the South on the day they fell into the hands of Union troops, what
      immense suffering might have been saved; how many rescued from premature
      graves, caused by inhuman treatment; and how many thousands could have
      been given the blessed boon of freedom, who were run into Texas, thence to
      Cuba and Brazil, and thence consigned to a fate worse than death itself!

      CHAPTER XII. LOYALTY VERSUS DISLOYALTY. PREJUDICE AND SELF-INTEREST
    </h2>
    <h3>
      PROMPTING THE ACTORS.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE definition
      given by lexicographers to the word loyalty, namely, "faithful to the
      lawful government," is so plain that no one can fail to comprehend it; and
      yet such were the complications in the late war between the United States
      and the Confederate States, that to no word could a greater variety of
      significations have been given. The Northern man claimed that to be loyal
      one must be faithful to the United States government, and all who were not
      so were rebels. The Southern man claimed that, after the organization of
      the Confederate States government, no man south of "Mason and Dixon's
      line" could be regarded as loyal who was not in favor of, and faithful to,
      that government. The extreme State-rights man claimed that to be loyal one
      must be faithful to the government of the State in which he resided, or of
      which he was a native. Each claimed theirs, and theirs only, to be the
      "lawful" government, and insisted that to be loyal one must be faithful to
      it, and to it alone, and that any lack of fidelity thereto was disloyalty,
      and could be nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      To illustrate by a figure once before used in this volume&mdash;that of a
      divorce suit between man and wife&mdash;it is easy enough to see how the
      children, taking the side of the father, might charge those who took the
      side of the mother with disloyalty to the family, and how those taking the
      side of the mother might retort by saying that else, the mother was quite
      as much a part of the family as the father, and that those who opposed her
      were more disloyal to the family than themselves. Thus criminations and
      recriminations might pass between the children of a divided household&mdash;divided
      in sentiment, if not yet by law&mdash;and if a third party were called in
      as arbitrator, it would be no easy matter for him to decide which of the
      two was right and which wrong. Viewing the subject from this stand-point,
      now that the prejudices and excitements of the war are over, it is not
      difficult to understand how President Davis, General Lee, General
      Beauregard, General Polk, and their adherents, regarded themselves quite
      as loyal as President Lincoln, General Grant, General Sherman, General
      Sheridan, and their followers. Each regarded theirs as the "lawful
      government," and that only by adhering to it, by being faithful to it,
      could one justly claim to be loyal.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was a third class in the war, who, while claiming to be faithful
      to one government, were, at heart, in favor of the other; who only wore
      the "garb of heaven" that they might the better "serve the devil;" who
      were ever ready to make promises to both sides, but who were true to
      neither; men who, like Marlborough, while pretending to be faithful to
      William III., was really plotting to restore James II. So well laid were
      Marlborough's plans, that Macaulay says, "Had Marlborough, therefore,
      after securing the cooperation of some distinguished officers, presented
      himself at the critical moment to those regiments which he had led to
      victory in Flanders and in Ireland, had he called on them to rally around
      him, to protect the Parliament, and to drive out the aliens (William's
      friends), there is strong reason to think that the call would have been
      obeyed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Writing of the disloyalty and treachery of many who surrounded the throne
      of William and Mary at that time (1691), Macaulay says: "Wicked and base
      as their conduct was, there was nothing in it surprising. They did after
      their kind. The times were troubled. A thick cloud was upon the future.
      The most sagacious and experienced politician could not see with any
      clearness three months before him. To a man of virtue and honor, indeed,
      this mattered little. His uncertainty as to what the morrow would bring
      forth, might make him anxious, but could not make him perfidious. Though
      left in utter darkness as to what concerned his interests, he had the sure
      guidance of his principles. But, unhappily, men of virtue and honor were
      not numerous among the courtiers of that age. Whitehall had been, during
      thirty years, a seminary of every public and private vice, and swarmed
      with low-minded, double-dealing, self-seeking politicians. The politicians
      now acted as it was natural that men profoundly immoral should act at a
      crisis of which none could predict the issue. Some of them might have a
      slight predilection for William; others a slight predilection for James;
      but it was not by any such predilection that the conduct of any of the
      breed was guided. If it had seemed certain that William would stand, they
      would all have been for William. If it had seemed certain that James would
      be restored, they would all have been for James. But what was to be done
      when the chances appeared to be almost exactly balanced? There were honest
      men of one party who would have answered, 'To stand by the true king and
      the true church, and, if necessary, die for them like Laud.' There were
      honest men of the other party who would have answered, 'To stand by the
      liberties of England and the Protestant religion, and, if necessary, die
      for them like Sidney.' But such consistency was unintelligible to many of
      the noble and the powerful. Their object was to be safe in every event.
      They therefore openly took the oath of allegiance to one king, and
      secretly plighted their word to the other. They were indefatigable in
      obtaining commissions, patents of peerage, pensions, grants of crown land,
      under the great seal of William, and they had in their secret drawers
      promises of pardon in the handwriting of James."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let the reader turn back and read this extract and the one preceding
      it about Marlborough, both from Macaulay's History of England, over again,
      carefully and considerately&mdash;putting the name of Abraham Lincoln in
      the place of William, wherever it occurs; and the name of Jefferson Davis
      in place of James, wherever it occurs, and whatever name he pleases in
      place of Marlborough's, and he will, we think, be entirely competent to
      draw his own similitudes, and to understand the causes of many things
      heretofore related in this volume, and of some which we purpose to relate
      in this chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another class of cases occasionally brought before the Provost-Court, at
      Alexandria, related to loyalty. To relate the details of one or two of
      these cases will give to the reader a general conception of the whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. E.'s usual residence was in Sussex County, New Jersey, but in some
      way, and at some time, he became the owner of a farm not many miles from
      Alexandria, Virginia. In throwing up earth-works at Munson's Hill and at
      other points, with a view to protect Washington and Alexandria, it so
      happened that Mr. E.'s farm was left about one mile outside of the Union
      lines. And it so happened, too, that the Confederates, in establishing
      their picket-line and temporary works of defence, made them about one mile
      the other side of Mr. E.'s farm. This left him literally "between two
      fires," for the mounted cannon on either side could throw a ball into his
      house at any moment, and squads of cavalry from both sides occasionally
      visited his house. Had he continued to look after his farming operations,
      and those only, he would probably not have been seriously disturbed by
      either side; but the love of the almighty dollar so far prevailed over his
      better judgment and his loyalty, that he concluded to try merchandising,
      in a surreptitious way, at his own farm-house. For years previous he had
      been in the habit of purchasing the supplies for his farm in Alexandria,
      which, with the fact that he was a Northern man and was presumed to be, as
      he professed to be, entirely loyal to the United States government, made
      it no trouble for him to procure passes in and out of the Union lines,
      whenever he had occasion to use them. After awhile it was observed that he
      passed in and out of the lines much oftener than he had been in the habit
      of doing when the line was first established, and that he usually drove a
      two-horse wagon, with a cloth cover over it, and apparently well filled
      within. It was observed, too, by officers, with their field-glasses, from
      the works at Munson's Hill, that Confederate cavalry visited Mr. E.'s
      house much oftener than they had been in the habit of doing during the
      first months of the war, and how many, both of cavalry and infantry,
      visited his place at night, of course they had no means of knowing. When
      Union cavalry or infantry visited his house, they never saw anything more
      than was usual about farm-houses, and he always welcomed them with the
      utmost cordiality. He regretted, he said, that Confederate soldiers
      visited his house so often. They seemed, he said, to suspicion that he was
      too intensely Union, but he quieted them by saying that while, of course,
      he was a Union man, and could be nothing else, yet he meant to be entirely
      neutral so long as the war continued, and, while he could do nothing for
      them, he would do nothing against them. The peculiarity of his situation,
      between the two lines, made this answer seem entirely reasonable to the
      Unionists who visited him, or who questioned him at any time, and passes
      continued to be issued to him whenever he applied for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus matters went on for weeks and months, until one day, when he was
      about passing a sentinel's post, the sentinel had the curiosity, not only
      to inquire, but to make a careful examination, of what he had in his
      wagon. He found barrels of sugar, bags of coffee, chests of tea, sacks of
      salt, barrels of whiskey, and such other articles as are usually kept and
      sold at country stores. The sentinel asked Mr. E. if he did not keep a
      store? Oh, no, he said, he bought these things all for his own use and for
      the use of his servants on the farm, of whom he had a large number. He
      never sold an ounce of anything to anybody, and kept his supplies so
      concealed that when rebels came to his house, as they did sometimes, they
      never could see anything. On no consideration would he sell or give
      anything to the rebels, and the Union soldiers, of course, never had
      occasion to buy anything outside of their lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      His manner, as well as his words, still further excited the suspicion of
      the sentinel, and so soon as he was relieved he went to his captain and
      told him all that had occurred. The captain reported the facts to his
      colonel, and received orders from him to instruct the sentinel on that
      post that when Mr. E. next attempted to pass out of the lines with a load
      of groceries to halt him, and bring him and his wagon to the regimental
      headquarters. Only a few days elapsed, when Mr. E. again attempted to pass
      out with a heavier load than at any time previous. When he showed his
      pass, as usual, the sentinel replied that his orders were to halt him
      until he could call the corporal of the guard. Mr. E. protested against
      the unnecessary detention, but, as the sentinel would not yield, he could
      do nothing else than wait until the corporal came. The corporal informed
      him that he must turn his team about and accompany him to the regimental
      headquarters. Mr. E. was now more alarmed than ever, and tried first to
      cajole and then to bribe the corporal and the sentinel to let him pass,
      but they would not listen to his overtures. Finding no other way, he
      turned his team about and accompanied the corporal to the regimental
      headquarters. The colonel examined Mr. E.'s load and found that it
      consisted principally of groceries. In reply to the question, What he did
      with them? he answered the colonel, as he had before answered the
      sentinel, that he used them for himself and the servants on his farm; that
      he did not sell an ounce to the rebels; would not, under any
      circumstances, etc., etc. The colonel listened respectfully to all that
      Mr. E. said, but did not believe a word of it. When he had finished, the
      colonel replied, very calmly but very determinately, that as Mr. E. was a
      private citizen, and could not, therefore, be tried by a court-martial, he
      must accompany him next morning to Alexandria, that all the facts of the
      case might be laid before the Provost-Judge of that city for such action
      as he might think proper. Meanwhile, his team and his goods would be well
      taken care of, and he should regard himself as in arrest. Mr. E.
      protested, but soon became satisfied that he was in the hands of one who
      could not be cajoled or trifled with, and that submission was his only
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning the colonel, accompanied by Mr. E., the corporal, and the two
      sentinels&mdash;the one who had examined Mr. E.'s load the first time and
      the one who had detained him last&mdash;went to Alexandria, reaching there
      about nine o'clock. They went direct to the general, headquarters, and the
      colonel at once communicated all the facts to Judge Freese. He replied
      that the provost-court met at ten o'clock, and that so soon as all other
      cases had been adjudicated this case should be heard, and that the
      colonel, his prisoner, and his witnesses should be in attendance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Promptly at ten o'clock the court opened. A dozen or more cases were heard
      and adjudicated, after which the case of Mr. E. was called. The first
      witness&mdash;the first sentinel&mdash;gave in his testimony just as
      detailed heretofore. The second sentinel and the corporal did the same.
      The colonel then related all that he knew about the case, and in the
      course of his testimony, said that he had known of Mr. E. ever since
      encamped where he then was; that he had frequently heard other officers
      speak of him; that he, with others, had often watched Mr. E.'s house
      through their field-glasses, and frequently seen rebel officers and
      privates coming and going; that for a week previous Mr. E. had gone
      backwards and forwards through the lines every day or two, usually in a
      two-horse covered wagon, and dressed as a hard-working farmer; that he
      always had with him a permit from the general commanding to pass in and
      out, and that his sentinels had never thought to question his right so to
      do until after the one sentinel took the liberty of looking in Mr. E.'s
      wagon, and found it filled with boxes and barrels; that since then he had
      talked the matter over with the general and several other officers, and
      all agreed in the opinion that Mr. E. was selling these supplies to the
      enemy; that, thereupon, he had directed the sentinel upon that post to be
      instructed to arrest him and bring him to his headquarters should he again
      attempt to pass with a loaded wagon; that his wagon, when so arrested, was
      loaded, as heavily as two horses could well draw, with groceries, liquors,
      etc., and that the team, wagon, groceries, and liquors were now in his
      camp subject to any order the court might make.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. E. was then called upon by the court to present any witnesses he might
      have, or to offer himself as a witness, or to say anything he could in his
      own defence, or all together, if he chose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. E. replied that he had no witnesses to offer, but, if the court
      please, would like to make a statement. He then repeated about the same
      story he had told the sentinel and the colonel, and added, that in Sussex
      County, New Jersey, where he was well known, nobody doubted his loyalty;
      that his father had, at one time, been a member of Congress from that
      State, and that he himself would probably have raised a company or a
      regiment of volunteers when the war commenced had he not owned this
      plantation in Virginia and had it to look after. He insisted upon his
      loyalty, and strongly urged his immediate release from arrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The court replied that cases of this kind were exceedingly perplexing at
      all times, and he, the Judge, would only be too glad if there were some
      other tribunal to which they could be referred; but as there was not, he
      could not do less than hear them, and after hearing, if he found cause for
      action, he could not do less than act. "In this case it was perfectly
      plain to the court that, notwithstanding Mr. E.'s denial, he had been
      selling groceries, liquors, etc., to officers and privates of General
      Lee's army, and might, therefore, fairly be presumed to have given 'aid
      and comfort to the enemy.' But the court did not believe that it had been
      done with any such intent. On the contrary, the court believed that it was
      the love of money&mdash;which is said to be the 'root of all evil'&mdash;that
      had induced the defendant to do just what he had done. Mr. E. is one of
      the thousands and tens of thousands throughout the North who, while making
      loud professions of loyalty, are all the while looking out for the 'main
      chance;' whose loyalty goes no deeper than their pockets; whose
      self-interests so far overbalance any sentiment of patriotism or loyalty,
      that they would be Lincoln men, or Davis men, just as they thought the one
      or the other was likely to win; who, while claiming the protection of one
      government and getting from it all they could, were all the while profuse
      in promises to the other, and ready to do for it whatever they could,
      whereby to put dollars in their own pockets or honors upon their own heads
      or shoulders. Nor is this sentiment confined to farmers and merchants, but
      the court regrets to have to believe it is to be found in the army, in the
      navy, in the very presence-chamber of the chief executive, and what is
      true of the North, the court has no doubt is equally true of the South,
      though not probably to so great an extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In this case the defendant, doubtless, excused himself somewhat on the
      ground that he was doing it upon his own property, and that he was doing
      it as a matter of self-preservation, which, as has been well said, is the
      'first law of nature.' But while such pleas would be entirely valid in
      time of peace, they are not valid in time of war. At such a time, all
      private interests have to yield to the public good, and what may seem like
      the taking away of natural rights from the one, may be justice, only
      justice, to the many. The defendant, too, though a man of general
      intelligence, was probably not aware that he was violating any law, State
      or national, in doing what he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Viewing the case from all these stand-points, the court has decided to
      suspend sentence upon this defendant until he shall be again found
      violating, or not fulfilling, the orders of the court. Meanwhile, the
      court orders that the goods now in Mr. E's wagon shall be brought back to
      Alexandria and returned to the parties from whom they were purchased;
      that, immediately after, whatever other goods may be found upon Mr. E.'s
      premises (other than enough to support the servants on the place for one
      month, if any servants at all be found there) shall be brought to this
      city and returned in like manner; that, after remaining one week longer on
      his farm, to 'put his house in order,' Mr. E. shall return to his home in
      Sussex County, New Jersey, and remain there until the war closes; that, if
      at any time after one week Mr. E. be found upon his farm, or in
      Alexandria, he be at once rearrested and brought before this court for
      sentence upon the charges now pending; and, if so brought, the defendant
      may rest assured that he will not have opportunity to give the enemy any
      aid and comfort after that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With you, Colonel W., the court leaves the execution of this order in all
      its details, and, while thanking you for what you have already done, will
      thank you still more when you have rendered this additional service for
      the government."
    </p>
    <p>
      The court then adjourned, and, of the large number present, there was
      probably not one, save the extremists on either side, who might be counted
      on one's fingers who did not approve of the action of the court in the
      case. It need only be added that the orders of the court were carried out
      to the letter; that Mr. E. returned to his home in New Jersey and remained
      there until the war ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another case, of altogether a different character, and yet involving the
      same principle&mdash;namely, that of disloyalty to the government by
      aiding the enemy in a surreptitious way&mdash;occurred not long after and
      was as follows:

    <p>
      The "Hutchinson Family," who had been giving a series of concerts in
      Washington, was invited by some New England regiments, encamped not far
      from Alexandria, to come to their encampments and give a series of
      concerts. The "Family" had accepted the invitation and given several
      concerts in pursuance thereof. Of course, their programme was made up
      largely of war lyrics&mdash;at that time by far the most popular songs
      with a Northern audience, and especially with soldiers&mdash;among which
      was that wonderful, soul-stirring poem by the Quaker poet, John G.
      Whittier, as follows:

      Though the regiments to which they sang were made up principally of
      anti-slavery men, yet there were a few proslavery men among them, and
      these objected, loudly and vehemently, to introducing or stimulating
      anti-slavery sentiments among the soldiers. Especially did they object to
      those lines by Whittier. This caused considerable discussion among both
      officers and men, which, through one of the pro-slavery officers, finally
      reached the ears of General McClellan, then in command of the forces south
      of the Potomac. The General, for reasons best known to himself, thereupon
      issued an order to the "Hutchinson Family" to sing no more in the camps,
      and retire at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      In obedience to this order, the "Family" left the camps and came to
      Alexandria, on their way to Washington. The reason for their leaving the
      camps had reached Alexandria before the coming of themselves, and had
      produced a very strong feeling among the Union men of the city against
      General McClellan, and in favor of the Hutchinsons.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching there, they were called upon by a number of leading citizens,
      among whom was Hon. Louis McKenzie, afterwards a member of Congress from
      that district, and then and always a consistent Union man. They requested
      the Hutchinsons to give a concert in the city before leaving, and promised
      them a large and sympathizing audience. The Hutchinsons were entirely
      willing to give a concert, provided they could be assured of protection;
      but, having just been ordered by General McClellan to leave his command,
      they feared to sing again south of the Potomac, unless they had
      permission, and promise of protection, from the local authorities. This
      the callers promised to procure, and at once went to the general
      headquarters for that purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      They at first called upon General Montgomery. He, while entirely
      sympathizing with their wishes, hesitated about giving such formal
      permission, or promising any such protection, for the reason, that, being
      within General McClellan's command, the General might regard it as a
      contempt of his order to the Hutchinsons; nevertheless he would impose no
      objections of any kind, and recommended the applicants to see Judge Freese
      about it. General Montgomery really desired to do all that the committee
      requested; but, for the reasons above stated, preferred that Judge Freese
      should do it, by virtue of his milito-civic authority as judge of the
      provost-court.
    </p>
    <p>
      The committee next called upon the Provost-Judge and laid all the facts
      before him, stating that General Montgomery had suggested that they call
      upon him. They urgently requested Judge Freese to grant the needed
      permission, with promise of personal protection. The Judge did not
      hesitate a moment to grant both requests. He told the committee that if
      the court, backed by the provost-guard, was not strong enough to protect
      peaceable citizens in the giving of a concert, no matter what was sung,
      the sooner the people knew it the better, and he was ready to test the
      matter at once. As to General McClellan's order, he regarded it as wholly
      unreasonable, and the army regulations required no officer to obey an
      "unreasonable" order. While he had a very high regard personally for
      General McClellan, he thought, in this matter, he had given too much heed
      to the enemies, and too little heed to the friends, of the government;
      and, whatever might be the consequences to himself, he had no hesitancy in
      granting the asked-for permission and promise of protection, even though
      General McClellan or his friends should regard it in direct contumacy of
      his order to the Hutchinsons. The Judge further said to the committee,
      that he "particularly desired <i>Whittier's great poem to be sung</i>, nor
      need the singers hesitate to introduce other war lyrics of like character&mdash;the
      more the better."
    </p>
    <p>
      The committee then procured one of the churches in which to hold the
      concert, and fixed upon the evening of the next day as the time. Meanwhile
      the Provost-Judge directed the Provost-Marshal to double the number of
      guards throughout the city for that night, from eight to twelve o'clock,
      and to have all who were not on post at the church while the concert was
      being held&mdash;each with loaded musket and fixed bayonet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news of the proposed concert spread rapidly through the city, and when
      the evening and hour arrived, every seat in the church was filled, while
      hundreds were gathered outside. The windows of the church were thrown wide
      open, that the citizens and soldiers outside might the better hear the
      words and music. The Provost-judge and Provost-Marshal took seats near the
      outer door, and it was observed that while they seemed to give one ear to
      the music, the other was given outside, to catch the first note of alarm,
      should any occur. General Montgomery expressed a very strong desire to
      attend the concert, but, out of courtesy to General McClellan, his
      commanding officer, thought he had better not, and therefore stayed away.
      The concert proceeded without an iota of disturbance, and gave great
      pleasure to the many hundreds present. Whittier's poem, and several others
      of like character, were so encored that the singers were obliged to repeat
      them. When the concert had ended, the Provost-judge and Provost-Marshal,
      with the guard which had been stationed about the church, accompanied the
      Hutchinsons to their lodgings, and left them in care of trusted friends.
      They were not disturbed through the night, and left next morning for
      Washington, well pleased with their stop-over at Alexandria.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not only a triumph over disloyalty, but another instance strongly
      illustrating the restraining power which the provost-court held in that
      community. The day preceding the concert, and the day of the evening on
      which it was held, there were loud threats not only among avowed
      secessionists, but among anti-administration men, that the concert should
      not be given. Their own personal and political prejudices had been so
      aroused, backed and stimulated by General McClellan's order, that a single
      spark would have ignited their whole magazine of passion; and but for the
      wholesome dread which they had of Judge Freese's "Bayonet Court," as they
      were then in the habit of calling it, that spark would undoubtedly have
      been applied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The love of money, old political prejudices, and inordinate ambition, were
      the three vile roots from which most of disloyalty sprang during the late
      war, both in the North and in the South; and the illustrations given in
      this chapter are but two of hundreds which might be given, if the proposed
      limits of this volume would allow.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>NOTHER class of
      cases brought before the provost-court at Alexandria related to disloyalty
      as affecting the property-rights of individuals. In the hasty evacuation
      of the city, when the Union troops were about coming in, many had left
      their carpets, furniture, pianos, bed? and bedding, cooking utensils,
      everything, indeed, except the clothing upon their persons and such few
      things as they could pack in trunks. In some cases, persons remaining in
      Alexandria had been given the keys of abandoned houses and stores and the
      goods within left in their charge; but in other cases, so great had been
      the fright and haste of the occupants, that even this precaution had not
      been observed. What was true of Alexandria was no less true of the country
      for several miles around. As regiment after regiment came over from
      Washington and encamped at points from one to five miles west and south of
      Alexandria, they found many farm-houses and gentlemen's residences
      abandoned, in which had been left the furniture, the pianos, the beds and
      bedding, and whatever else could not be carried away in trunks. Of course,
      all such abandoned residences were appropriated for headquarters of
      divisions, brigades, and regiments, so far as they were needed for such
      purposes; and, in Alexandria, such residences as were not needed for
      headquarters were quickly applied for (or taken possession of in many
      cases without any application to the General commanding) by those who came
      to the city for purposes of trade, and for other purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far everything progressed with what seemed to be a sort of general
      consent; but pretty soon a new class of questions arose, in which there
      was a decided difference of opinion, not only as between Union citizens
      and secessionists, but between Union officers and Union soldiers as well.
      These questions arose from an assumed right, upon the part of some, to
      appropriate for their own individual use and profit whatever had been
      abandoned by those who had gone into the Confederate lines, and who
      thereby had openly declared themselves not only disloyal, but hostile, to
      the United States government.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who assumed such right, attempted to justify their opinions and
      their acts by referring to the Act of the United States Congress of
      August, 1861, by which all property used for insurrectionary purposes was
      made liable to confiscation; and they further claimed that it was but a
      fair retaliation to the Act of the Confederate Congress, by which the
      property of all Union men, living within the Confederate lines, was made
      liable to sequestration.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Montgomery was among those who believed that, while the army, as
      an army, had a right to make use of property abandoned by an enemy,
      individuals, whether as officers, soldiers, or citizens, had no such
      right; and among his first acts, after being appointed Military Governor
      of Alexandria, was to direct his Assistant Adjutant-General to issue an
      order forbidding the use of abandoned property, without permission first
      had from general headquarters; and when the provost-court was established,
      he directed Judge Freese to see that that order be in no way violated or
      evaded. In every case reported to the Judge, where an attempt was made to
      take an article from an abandoned house and appropriate it to the private
      use of the taker, whether officer, soldier, or citizen, the party was
      directed to refrain, or, if already taken, to return it at once, under the
      penalty of arrest and punishment. This soon became so generally understood
      in Alexandria that no further attempt was made to appropriate abandoned
      property for private use and profit there; but, after a time, a case arose
      from the country, which required the interposition of the court, a trial
      of the case, and a judgment; and it is this case which we now propose to
      relate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. W. was the assistant surgeon of the Fourth-Volunteers, and as good a
      man, in every respect, as one often meets. When the government called for
      troops, he was among the first to offer his services, though at that time
      doing a large practice, having a large family to support, and having but
      little of this world's goods; and when the Fourth regiment was organized,
      the governor of his State appointed him its assistant surgeon. This
      regiment was among the first to reach Washington, and the second to
      establish a camp beyond Alexandria. The colonel of the regiment was a
      wide-awake New Englander, an intense anti-slavery man, an ardent admirer
      and supporter of President Lincoln, one who believed that a secessionist,
      by becoming disloyal to the government, forfeited all the rights he ever
      possessed, and that this forfeiture extended to property quite as well as
      to personal rights. Though he was never known to appropriate any abandoned
      property to his own private use or profit, yet he had no scruples of using
      it himself, and of allowing others of his regiment to use whatever fell in
      their way; and if any of his officers or soldiers asked to appropriate to
      their own use anything which they had found, he never answered nay. That
      he was entirely conscientious in all this, no one that knew the man
      doubted for a moment, however much they might differ with him in political
      opinion. With a commanding officer holding such decided views, it was not
      at all surprising that his lieutenant-colonel, major, assistant-surgeon,
      adjutant, and almost, if not quite, every company officer should, erelong,
      become as decided as himself upon this question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near the spot on which they fixed for an encampment was a large house,
      which had been abandoned by its owner and occupant on the morning that the
      Union troops marched into Alexandria. So hasty had been the flight that
      even the breakfast-table, with the dishes upon it, was left standing in
      the centre of the dining-room. Not an article of furniture, so far as
      could be seen, had been removed. The house had been well furnished, and,
      among other things, had a piano, about half worn. This had doubtless been
      played upon by daughters of the family as well as by the wife, as there
      were articles lying about the parlor which plainly indicated recent
      occupancy by young ladies. The piano stood open when the colonel, doctor,
      and other of his officers first entered the house, and that most exquisite
      of all musical compositions, "Home, Sweet Home," was open on the
      music-holder.
    </p>
    <p>
      This house the colonel at once appropriated for the headquarters of his
      regiment, and not only he, but his lieutenant-colonel, major, doctor, and
      adjutant slept and messed there. They slept in the beds, lounged on the
      sofas, ate from the table, drank from the sideboard, and used nearly
      everything about the house except the piano. No one of the officers
      played, and erelong the piano became one of the neglected, if not one of
      the useless, articles about the house. One day, when they were all
      lounging in the parlor, the doctor said to the colonel:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a world of pleasure that piano would give my wife and daughters if I
      only had it at my own home!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," replied the colonel, "why then don't you send it to your own home?
      The owner, or once owner&mdash;for I hold, you know, that rebels forfeit
      everything, even their lives&mdash;is not here to object, and I am sure I
      won't."
    </p>
    <p>
      This led to a general conversation on the subject among all the officers
      present, the conclusion of which was that the doctor should have the piano
      boxed, and sent to his family as soon as he could conveniently. This, of
      course, pleased the doctor greatly, and on the following day he got
      together boards, and a carpenter, had a suitable box made, the piano
      carefully packed, and on the day following sent it to Alexandria, with
      orders to have it forwarded to his home, in New England, as speedily as
      possible. When it was being unloaded at the shipping warehouse, one of the
      provost-guard chanced to be present, and inquired of' those who brought it
      where it came from, who sent it, and where it was being sent to? Those who
      brought it answered all these questions without hesitancy, nor did they
      see any wrong in all that was being done; but the provost-guard, knowing
      what the orders in the city were upon that subject, felt it to be his duty
      to inform the Provost-Marshal of what he had seen, and no sooner did the
      Marshal learn of it, than he informed the Provost-judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge directed the Marshal to go at once to the shipping merchant, and
      direct him not to send that box away until further orders from the court.
      He next directed the Marshal to call that afternoon upon the doctor and
      the colonel, and request their presence at the court-room next morning at
      ten o'clock. Should they decline to attend by request, to inform him at
      once, when he would order their arrest; but he much preferred to have all
      the facts inquired into without arrests, if it could be done as well. The
      Marshal called upon the colonel and the doctor that same afternoon,
      delivered the Judge's message, and both promised to be at the courtroom
      next morning without fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Promptly, as per promise, the colonel, the doctor, and several other
      officers of the regiment were at the courtroom next morning. The doctor,
      it was plain to see, felt a little skary, but the colonel was so confident
      of the justice of his case that he rejoiced in the opportunity of
      convincing the Judge that for once, at least, he was in the wrong. When
      all the other cases before the court had been disposed of, the Judge
      turned to the doctor, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now the court will hear your case."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor at once arose, and said he was there in obedience to the orders
      of the court, but was not at all aware with what crime he was charged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge replied that, as yet, he was not accused of any crime, nor was
      he present by the "order," but rather by the request, of the court: The
      Judge then stated all that he had learned concerning the piano, and how he
      had directed the shipping merchant not to send it away until further
      orders from the court; that he had not issued an order for arrest, for the
      reason that he much preferred to have the whole matter inquired into
      amicably, as he was under the impression that all done thus far had been
      from error of judgment rather than from any intent to do wrong; but, if
      this course were declined, then there was but one other way left&mdash;namely,
      arrest, trial, and judgment, whatever it might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor and the colonel both replied that they much preferred an
      amicable hearing of the case, and were ready, whenever it might please the
      court, to state all the facts within their knowledge, either under oath or
      upon their honors as gentlemen and officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge expressed his pleasure at this frank manner of meeting the case,
      and told the doctor to proceed, "upon his honor as a gentleman and
      officer," to state all the facts of the case within his knowledge&mdash;to
      which he might add any arguments he pleased by way of justification.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor, thus assured and placed entirely at his ease, proceeded, in a
      calm, pleasant way, to state just what had occurred, and how it occurred,
      since their occupancy of that abandoned house. He particularly detailed
      the conversation that had incidentally occurred between the colonel and
      himself, which led to the packing up and sending away of the piano&mdash;all
      of which, he said, could be confirmed by several officers then in the
      courtroom; that he had done nothing secretly or surreptitiously, nor had
      he once dreamed that he was doing a wrong in anything he had done; but if,
      in the judgment of the court, it was wrong, he was quite ready to undo all
      that he had done, and have the piano put back exactly where he had found
      it. As to the matter of justification, he preferred to leave that in the
      hands of his colonel, who had given, to the subject more thought, and
      could better express those thoughts than himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge then extended to the colonel the same invitation he had given
      the doctor, and upon the same terms. The colonel thanked the Judge for the
      courtesy, and then proceeded to state the facts exactly as the doctor had
      stated them, and exactly as heretofore given in this chapter. This
      finished, he next entered upon an argument to prove that all that a man
      had of personal rights, of property, and even of life, he forfeited when
      he became disloyal to his government. He laid special stress upon the act
      of sequestration passed by the rebel or Confederate Congress, and said
      that the taking of abandoned property by Unionists on this side of the
      line was only a fair retaliation for what the rebels were doing with the
      Union people of the South. He also referred to the act of confiscation
      then recently passed by the United States Congress, and contended that if
      the government thought it right to confiscate the property of rebels in a
      wholesale way, individuals were certainly justified in doing it in a
      retail way. The colonel was earnest, at times quite eloquent, and
      certainly made the best argument that could possibly be made on that side
      of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the colonel had finished, the Judge inquired whether any other person
      present desired to make a statement or an argument in the case. Being
      answered in the negative, Judge Freese then proceeded to state his own
      views as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The court is obliged, very greatly obliged, both to the doctor and to the
      colonel, for the cordial manner in which they have met the issues of this
      case. The court was reasonably satisfied before, but is still better
      satisfied now, that nothing of wrong was intended in all that had been
      done; that it was simply an error of judgment, and that none will be found
      more ready than themselves to correct the error so soon as they are
      satisfied that it is an error. About the facts of the case there is no
      dispute whatever. All the statements agree. The only question, therefore,
      is as to the reason or the law of the case. This court is not strictly a
      law court. It is rather a court of necessity&mdash;of a 'necessity that
      knows no law'&mdash;or of equity; but in this particular case it might
      well afford to stand upon the law alone, even if there were no equities in
      the case to be considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The act passed by the United States Congress, on the 6th of August last,
      known as the 'Confiscation Act,' provides that, 'in the present or any
      future insurrection, any property given to aid such insurrection, or used
      for that purpose with the knowledge and consent of the owner, shall be
      subject to seizure and confiscation; that actions for the condemnation of
      such property shall be brought in circuit, district, or admiralty courts
      having jurisdiction of the amount, and that the attorney-general, or any
      district attorney, may institute proceedings, which in such cases <i>shall
      be wholly for the benefit of the United States, etc</i>.' It will be
      observed how carefully Congress has pointed out every step of the way by
      which this act shall be executed; and in order to avoid any possibility of
      private peculation, the act says, in so many words, 'such case shall be
      wholly&mdash;not in part, but wholly&mdash;for the benefit of the United
      States.' There is nothing in this act to justify a private individual in
      taking so much as the value of a pin from a house abandoned by an avowed
      enemy, much less from the house of one who still claims the protection of
      the common laws of his country, though in temporary rebellion against the
      authorities now in power. The court, it will be remarked, puts emphasis
      upon the words <i>private individual</i>; for it holds that, for purposes
      of the army, for purposes of attack and defence, for purposes of
      sustenance and locomotion, or even for purposes of comfort, an army, or
      any regularly organized part of an army, may seize, hold, and use any
      property, real or personal, that may have belonged to those now in arms
      against that government.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The colonel has also referred to the act passed by the Confederate
      Congress, on the 30th of August last, known as the 'Sequestration Act,'
      and thinks the passage of that act justifies Union men in appropriating to
      their own use any property that may have been abandoned by the enemy. That
      act was passed about three weeks after the 'Confiscation Act' by the
      United States Congress, and shows upon its face that it was altogether
      retaliatory. Indeed, one section of the act says this in so many words.
      That section, which really gives the animus of the whole act, reads as
      follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Be it enacted by the Congress of the Confederate States, that all lands,
      goods, rights, and credits within these Confederate States owned by any
      alien enemy since the 21st of May, 1861, be sequestrated by the
      Confederate States of America, and shall be held for the full indemnity of
      any citizen and resident of these Confederate States, or other person
      aiding said Confederate States in the prosecution of the present war, and
      for which' he may suffer any loss or injury under the act of the United
      States to which this act is retaliatory, authorizing the seizure or
      confiscation of the property of citizens or residents of the Confederate
      States; and the same shall be seized and disposed of as provided for in
      this act' Even this act, emanating from a spirit of revenge and
      retaliation, gives no authority, in any part of it, to private individuals
      to seize for their own use and benefit any property belonging to a Union
      man; but expressly declares in the section just quoted, that 'the same
      shall be seized and disposed of as provided for in this act; and the
      provisions referred to are quite as stringent and precise as those in the
      United States 'Confiscation Act.' heretofore quoted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The reason why all governments are thus particular in pointing out the
      exact mode by which an enemy's property may be seized and appropriated, is
      plain enough, if one will but stop and consider it. Without such
      particularity of procedure, an army going into an enemy's country would
      soon become a rabble or mob&mdash;war would soon become rapine&mdash;officers
      would soon lose all control of their men, and from thenceforth plundering,
      spoliation, and pillage would become the order of the day. Yea, more, it
      would have the effect to set an army to warring among themselves, for each
      officer and each soldier would want the 'lion's share,' and it would only
      be a question of strength and endurance as to which should have it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the matter of the piano now in question, what more right had the
      doctor to it than the major? what more right had the major to it than any
      one of the ten captains of the regiment? What more right had any captain
      to it than any one of the twenty lieutenants? or what more right had any
      lieutenant to it than any one of the one thousand privates? If it were a
      question of strength only, the strongest man in the regiment would finally
      gain the prize, even though he had to walk over the dead body of every
      other man in the regiment to gain it. The court thinks that even the
      doctor, though he had his hands full of scalpels, or the colonel, though a
      sword were suspended from every hair of his head, would shrink from a
      contest of this character!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Again, it should be borne in mind that, though property may have been
      abandoned temporarily by its owner, he may afterwards repent of such
      abandonment and reclaim possession. Bouvier, in his admirable '<i>Institutes
      of American Law</i>,' says: 'Things that have been abandoned by the owner
      belong to the first occupant; but if the owner should repent of having
      thrown away or abandoned the thing, <i>he may retake it before any one
      else, and he regains his former title</i>. To entitle the finder to such
      chattels, the former owner, must have wholly abandoned his title; if, as
      in the case of a wreck, he has parted with the possession on the ground of
      necessity, or with the evident intention of resuming it, the property has
      never been abandoned.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Again, he says: 'The right of acquiring personal chattels by finding, is
      limited to those found upon the surface of the earth. It does not extend
      to goods found derelict at sea, though abandoned without hope of recovery,
      nor to goods or money found hidden in the earth, known by the name of <i>treasure
      trove</i>. In England such goods belong to the crown; in this country the
      title to them perhaps has been seldom questioned in the hands of the
      finder, except by the real owner. No title by occupancy can in this
      country be gained in waifs, or stolen goods thrown away or scattered by a
      thief in his flight, in order to effect his escape. In England they belong
      to the King; here this prerogative has never been adopted by the
      government against the true owner, and never, perhaps, put in practice
      against the finder, though against him there would be a better reason for
      adopting it. Nor can any title be gained by occupancy of estrays, or
      cattle whose owner is unknown, or of wrecks, or such goods as after a
      shipwreck are cast upon the land by the sea, and left there, within some
      county, so as not to belong to the jurisdiction of the admiralty, but to
      the common law.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kent in his <i>Commentaries</i> lays down the same principles, and both
      he and Bouvier cite a large number of decisions, both English and American
      cases, to prove the correctness of the doctrine. Indeed, the principle has
      been so universally adopted, that it would be difficult to find a court,
      in this or any other civilized country, that would not enforce it, in
      every case where the question of abandoned property was brought before
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is the first attempt, so far as the court knows, to take a piano
      from any one of the many abandoned houses in this city and vicinity; but
      frequent attempts have been made to take smaller and less valuable
      articles; and, in every instance, where it has come to the knowledge of
      the court, the person making the attempt has been required to return the
      article to the place where found. Nor can the court make any exception to
      the rule in this case. If, from the law and reasons stated by the court,
      the doctor and the colonel have become satisfied that they committed an
      error in the taking of the piano, and will, without delay, return it to
      the exact place where they found it, and promise to protect it from
      removal or damage hereafter, or so long, at least, as they continue to
      occupy the house for their headquarters, then no further steps need be
      taken in this case. If they are not so convinced, and decline to make any
      such promise, then the duty of the court will be to order them both in
      arrest, and that the piano be taken in charge by the Provost-Marshal, to
      await the further orders of the court."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor immediately arose and said he "desired to extend his most
      hearty thanks to the court for the many courtesies which had been extended
      towards him, and to add, that the reasonings of the court had entirely
      satisfied him of his error; that he would, without one moment of
      unnecessary delay, have the piano returned to the house from whence taken;
      and that from thenceforth, and so long as he remained in the army, he
      would use whatever influence he possessed towards preventing the taking of
      abandoned property for individual purposes."
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel then arose and said he was "reminded of the old maxim, that it
      'took a bolder man to confess an error than to face a cannon's mouth,' and
      while he laid no claim to boldness, he did claim to be able to do what he
      believed to be right; and since he had heard the law and reason of the
      case, as laid down by the court, he was free to confess that he had all
      along been in error, and that the court was in the right." He had, he
      said, such "an utter detestation for disloyalty, that nothing, he thought,
      could be too great punishment for a rebel, and he had regarded the taking
      of their property&mdash;no matter when, how, or by whom&mdash;as a part of
      their just punishment; but the reasoning of the court had made it entirely
      clear to his mind that, while this could be properly done by the
      government for the general good, it could not be properly done by
      individuals for their private gain." He, like the doctor, would "turn a
      short corner on this subject, and from thenceforth use whatever influence
      he possessed to discourage the taking of abandoned or captured property
      for private uses. So long as he retained his present headquarters, he
      would see that nothing was removed from the premises, and, so far as it
      was possible, he would have returned whatever had been taken away."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus ended, pleasantly and satisfactorily, what, at one time, threatened
      to be a very ugly case. Had the doctor and colonel chosen to disregard the
      request of the court, and insisted upon their right to send the piano to
      the doctor's home, it would have brought on a direct conflict of
      authority, necessitated arrests, caused appeals to higher authorities, and
      created confusion generally; but their respect for the court was such as
      to overcome all these unhappy consequences. On the afternoon of the same
      day on which the case was heard, the colonel sent a team to the
      Provost-Marshal's office; the Marshal went with the driver to the office
      of the shipping-merchant and directed the delivery of the piano; and
      before sundown of that day, the piano stood in the exact spot from which
      it had been taken a few days before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The triumph of reason over error and prejudice was complete. From
      thenceforth the long-mooted and often discussed question, as to how
      disloyalty affected the rights of property, was settled in and about
      Alexandria. There was no further attempt to appropriate abandoned property
      for private uses.

      CHAPTER XV. A NEW WAY TO PAY OLD DEBTS. JUSTICE SHIFTING THE SCENES AND

      PROMPTING THE ACTORS.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>NOTHER class of
      questions which came before the provost-court at Alexandria excited at the
      time a large amount of interest; was discussed to some extent by many of
      the ablest journals of the country; resulted in the payment of several old
      debts&mdash;amounting to many thousands of dollars&mdash;in an entirely
      new way; and as no correct account thereof has ever yet appeared in
      historical form, we purpose in this chapter to relate the facts and
      incidents connected with one or two of the cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the causes of the war had been brewing for many, many years; though
      it was, indeed, as Mr. Seward had long before called it, an "irrepressible
      conflict," which could only be settled by the sacrifice of thousands of
      lives and millions of treasure; though threats, louder, deeper, and more
      ominous, came year after year from Southern States, and that, too, from a
      class of men whom all acknowledged could act as well as threaten whenever
      they chose to put their threats into execution,&mdash;yet, when the storm
      did finally burst upon the country, it seemed to tens of thousands in the
      North like a clap of thunder from a clear sky, so wholly were they
      unprepared for it. Especially was this true among merchants, and still
      more especially was it true with that class of merchants who, for many
      years previously, had been selling goods to Southern merchants, and buying
      from them cotton, sugar, rice, and tobacco. These merchants had, of
      course, a great many pleasant personal acquaintances throughout the South;
      they had often been at their customers' stores, dined with their families,
      been upon their plantations, visited their sugar-mills, witnessed the
      workings of their cotton-gins, admired the wonderful power of their
      cotton-presses, heard their negroes sing while picking the cotton,
      listened in raptures to the peculiar melodies of the negroes as they
      stripped the tobacco leaf or rolled it into fragrant cigars, and though,
      even at such times and in such places, they had frequently heard Southern
      merchants and Southern planters complain of what they called "Northern
      interference with slavery" and "Northern oppression because of tariffs,"
      etc., etc., yet it had never occurred to them as possible that the time
      would come when these same men would try to break loose from the North and
      set up for themselves a separate confederacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such had been the confidences between Northern and Southern merchants,
      that, for years previous to the war, the former had been in the habit of
      selling the latter goods on a whole year's credit This was necessitated,
      in part, from the fact that planters had got behind in their finances, and
      were compelled to pledge their next year's crops for their present year's
      supplies; but it was owing much more to the fact that confidence, very
      great confidence, had become established between the Northern and the
      Southern merchant. This confidence, and consequent long credit, resulted
      in the fact that, when the war actually commenced, the merchants and
      planters of the South owed the merchants and cotton factors of the North
      the enormous sum of two hundred millions of dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some part of this debt would probably have been paid had the Southern
      merchant and planter been left to his own free choice; but the
      governmental and military authorities of the South, with a view to cripple
      the North and strengthen themselves, had a law passed so early in the
      contest as May 21st, 1861, prohibiting all debtors owing money to Northern
      creditors from paying them, and requiring the payment of the amount into
      the Confederate treasury, either in specie or treasury notes, for which
      they were to receive a certificate of the payment bearing interest and
      redeemable at the close of the war. How much of the sum due the North was
      ever paid into the Confederate treasury is not known, but probably a very
      small proportion of the whole amount. The Government having virtually
      repudiated the claim towards the one to whom the debt was actually due, it
      was not unnatural that the merchant should repudiate it towards the
      Government, and when asked the question how much he owed the merchants of
      New York, Philadelphia, or Boston, his answer was, "Nothing at all," nor
      was the creditor or any one else present to dispute his answer. In this
      way at least one hundred and ninety of the two hundred millions due the
      North escaped payment altogether, while even the ten millions which we
      suppose to have been paid into the Confederate treasury were absorbed by
      English capitalists and others like the mist of a summer morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the Southern merchants who owed considerable amounts to merchants
      and manufacturers of the North were those of Alexandria. What may have
      been the gross amount of their indebtedness to the North is not definitely
      known, but certainly tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after the provost-court had been established in Alexandria,
      manufacturers and merchants began to come there to look after debts due
      them from the merchants of that city. Such as had not fled made such
      response as they could&mdash;paying in money if they had it and desired to
      continue in business, or returning to their creditors so much of their
      remaining stock as would satisfy their claims. Only in one instance, where
      the debtor remained in Alexandria, was the creditor obliged to call upon
      the Provost-Judge for assistance. In that case the debtor pleaded, as an
      excuse for non-payment, the act of the Confederate Congress of May 21st,
      heretofore spoken of. He wanted, he said, to pay&mdash;"of course he
      wanted to pay; but, being a Southern man, and with that act staring him in
      the face, he did not see how he could." The creditor called upon Judge
      Freese and acquainted him with the facts as above stated. The Judge sent
      for the debtor to meet the creditor at his private office. He there told
      the debtor that "the excuse he offered for nonpayment was no excuse at all&mdash;indeed,
      worse; for, besides being a mere subterfuge, it was a virtual
      acknowledgment of his own disloyalty; that it mattered not at all what
      laws the Confederate Congress had passed or might pass, they could not be
      recognized by the citizens of Alexandria so long as it remained in
      possession of the Union troops, and that was likely to be so long as the
      war continued; and that if he had the means to pay his creditor, the
      sooner he did it the better!" Within an hour the debt was paid, and it was
      the last of that kind of cases in which the Judge had to interfere, as
      within twenty-four hours the facts of this case were known to every
      merchant of Alexandria.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was another class of cases which came thick and fast, and for
      awhile gave the court a vast amount of trouble. To relate the origin, the
      incidents, and the results of a few of these will be the object of this
      chapter. The first was as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. S. was an old resident of Alexandria, and for several years before the
      war had been keeping an agricultural and hardware store in that city. He
      was regarded by his neighbors as a highly honorable merchant, and being a
      man of considerable means, had always met his payments promptly. He was a
      Virginian by birth, and when the contest began between the North and the
      South, promptly took sides with the South. Indeed, he had advocated
      secession so strongly and so loudly that he feared he would be arrested
      for disloyalty if he remained in Alexandria, so, when the Union troops
      were about coming in and the Confederate troops about going out, he
      retired with them. He did this, however, so unexpectedly, and in so much
      of a hurry, that he had no time to make a formal sale and transfer of his
      stock of goods to any one; but, on the morning that he left, he handed the
      key of his store to a neighbor and told him to look after his affairs
      until he returned, or until he could make some other arrangement. The
      neighbor did as requested, kept the store open, sold whatever he could for
      ready cash, and transmitted the money to Mr. S. whenever he had
      opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus matters were going on when a Philadelphia merchant, to whom Mr. S.
      was indebted, went to Alexandria to look after his claim. He had written
      several letters, addressed to Mr. S., Alexandria, Va., but could get no
      reply, and began to suspect that he might have left the city, though he
      had no positive information to that effect until he reached there. He
      inquired of the man whom he found in the store of the whereabouts of Mr.
      S., and was told that he had left, on the coming in of the Union troops;
      but where he had gone, or exactly where he then was, the man in the store
      pretended not to know. The Philadelphian said he had a claim, past due, of
      several hundred dollars, against Mr. S., and would like to have it settled
      in some way. The agent replied that he had not been authorized by Mr. S.
      to pay any debts, and, besides that, the Confederate Congress had passed a
      law requiring all men who owed debts to Northern merchants to pay the
      amount into the Confederate treasury, and it was possible that Mr. S.
      might have already paid off the claim by paying it into the Southern
      treasury.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Philadelphian replied that he did not recognize any such payment as
      cancelling his claim; and, as he observed some of the very goods he had
      sold Mr. S. then in the store-room, he thought the agent ought to be
      willing to return him those goods, which he would take in payment at cost
      price, and then to pay him the balance in money. The agent said he could
      not, for one moment, entertain any such proposition. That, the goods
      having been placed in his care by Mr. S. when he left, he regarded himself
      as the owner of them, and could not think of returning any part of them to
      Mr. S.'s creditors, nor of disposing of them in any other way, except for
      cash in hand. The Philadelphian tried to convince the agent of the justice
      and reasonableness of the proposition he had made, and finally offered to
      accept of goods, at cost price, for the whole of his claim; but the longer
      he reasoned, the more obstinate grew the agent, until at last the agent
      said he could not, and would not, do anything about it; that the debt was
      not his own anyhow; that it possibly had been paid into the Confederate
      treasury, and, if so, was legally paid; and that it was only a waste of
      time and breath to talk to him any more about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Philadelphian, having read something in the newspapers about Judge
      Freese's "Bayonet Court," concluded to seek the Judge and see if there was
      not some way by which his claim might be enforced. Going to his office, he
      told the Judge the whole case, and begged that he would aid him in some
      way to secure his claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge replied that the provost-court had been established only with a
      view of preserving the peace of the city, and the personal and property
      rights of individuals, and not with any view whatever of collecting
      claims; that if its jurisdiction was enlarged to include civil as well as
      criminal cases, the business might prove larger than any one court could
      do, and thereby defeat wholly, or in part, its original intention; that
      whatever he could do by moral suasion to induce Mr. S.'s agent to pay his
      claim, he would most cheerfully do, but as to opening the court for the
      hearing and adjudication of such cases, it was more than he could at
      present consent to do. He would, he added, send for Mr. S.'s agent and see
      what, if anything, could be done. He accordingly sent an orderly to
      request the agent to come to the headquarters immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the agent made his appearance, the Judge told him why he had been
      sent for, and strongly urged him to make some equitable arrangement
      whereby to settle the claim of the Philadelphia merchant. The agent made
      about the same reply to the Judge that he had made to the Philadelphian,
      to all of which the Judge listened attentively without uttering a word.
      When he had entirely finished, the Judge said he would like to ask him a
      few questions to which he would like direct answers. To this the agent
      assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      "First, then," said the Judge, "did Mr. S., before leaving, execute to you
      a bill of sale, or any other paper, by which to make the goods yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied the agent, "he did not; but when about to leave he handed me
      the key of his store, and told me to take care of the goods until his
      return, or until he might make some other arrangement."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," said the Judge, "the goods are no more legally yours than they are
      mine, and you are simply acting as guard over them. Have you not been
      selling some of the goods?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," replied the agent; "I understood the care to include the right to
      sell, and have accordingly sold of the goods whenever I had opportunity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you done with the money received from sales?" said the Judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agent became confused, hesitated, stammered, and finally got out that
      he had "sent some of it to Mr. S., and still had some of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it is your intention, I suppose." said the Judge, "to send it all to
      him so soon as you shall have sold all the goods?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, certainly," said the agent; "it would all belong to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you think that no part of it would belong to his creditors; but that
      all should go to him?" said the Judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, yes, about so," said the agent; "for if he has paid his debts once
      into the Confederate treasury, as I suppose he has or will, it would seem
      unreasonable that he should pay them again to such Northern merchants as
      he may happen to owe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you not aware," said the Judge, "that any law passed by the
      Confederate Congress is a nullity in Alexandria, and can have no possible
      effect on the question of contracts?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, yes, no, yes; but Alexandria, you know, is in Virginia, and Mr. S.,
      you know, is at Richmond."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! at Richmond, is he? Only a little while ago you told this creditor
      that you did not know where he was, and I understood you to say the same
      in your story to me, and now, all at once, when you seek to screen him
      from justice and from Northern laws, you recollect that he is at Richmond.
      Very well, sir, then to the Richmond authorities he must look for
      protection, while this Northern merchant has no protection save through
      our provost-court, and though I told him, previous to your coming here,
      that the court could not take up such cases, yet now that I have heard
      your story, and see that by allowing you to retain and sell the goods will
      virtually be to give 'aid and comfort to the enemy,' while to interfere in
      behalf of this merchant will be to weaken the enemy, by cutting off some
      of his resources, besides doing an act of simple justice&mdash;in view, I
      say, of all these facts, I am now resolved to take up this case, and the
      first step in the case will be for the court to take possession of the
      store-room and all of its contents until the case can be heard and
      adjudicated. You will at once hand the key of the store-room, after
      closing it carefully, to the Provost-Marshal. He will place a guard over
      the premises to see that nothing is taken away or disturbed until the case
      is heard and decided, and to-morrow morning, at ten o'clock, you will be
      at the court with any books, papers, or witnesses you may have, when the
      case will be heard."
    </p>
    <p>
      Had a bombshell fallen and burst at the feet of the agent, he could not
      have been more surprised. For some moments he seemed so dumbfounded that
      he could not, or did not, utter a word. Then, slowly arising to his feet,
      he was about to leave, when the Judge told him to again be seated, to
      await the coming of the Provost-Marshal, for whom he had sent.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Marshal made his appearance, the Judge directed him to accompany
      the agent to the store-room, to see that every window and every door was
      securely closed and fastened, to then place a guard both at the front and
      at the rear of the premises, and to see that they were regularly relieved
      and replaced, the same as other guards of the city, until further orders
      from the court, and meanwhile to retain the key of the store-room in his
      own possession, and see that nothing whatever was removed from the
      premises.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agent then left with the Marshal, and all was done precisely as
      directed. That the Philadelphia merchant was pleased with the turn things
      had taken need hardly be added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, at ten o'clock, the Philadelphia merchant, the agent, and about
      a dozen friends of the agent, including the secession lawyer heretofore
      spoken of, appeared at the court-room. When all the police cases had been
      disposed of, the court said it was now ready to hear the civil case, in
      which, upon the court record, Mr. G., of Philadelphia, was named as
      plaintiff, and Mr. T., of Alexandria, as agent for Mr. S., was named as
      defendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. G. arose, and said that he had no attorney to represent him in this
      case, and that he was himself wholly unacquainted with court proceedings,
      and did not know even how to take the first step. He begged to inquire of
      the court what was needed to be done upon his part?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge replied that the first thing required of him was to prove his
      claim against Mr. S., beyond any reasonable doubt. To do this he must
      produce his original books of entry, and prove by the one who sold the
      goods, or by some one who knows of their delivery, that the goods charged
      in the original entry were actually sold and delivered to Mr S., and then
      you or some one else must, under oath or affirmation, satisfy the court
      that they have never been paid for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. G. replied that all this could be done if a few days' time could be
      given him; that he had not brought his account-books with him, nor was the
      clerk who sold the goods present. He could himself at once make affidavit
      as to the correctness of the account, and to the fact that it had never
      been paid, but beyond this he could not go until he could send to
      Philadelphia for his books and clerk; that he could have his books and
      clerk present if the court would adjourn the case for two days.
    </p>
    <p>
      The court said that, under the circumstances, it would be entirely proper
      to grant the adjournment asked for by the plaintiff; but, to justify the
      Marshal in longer retaining the goods, the court would require Mr. G. to
      make a written state-of-demand against Mr. S., setting forth the nature
      and amount of his claim, and the fact that the claim had never been paid
      in any way, and was now justly due and owing to him. To this he must set
      his name, and then make affidavit that the statement is true. Upon this,
      as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the claim, the court will direct the
      Marshal to continue possession of the goods until the case can be heard.
      The court asked the defendant if he had any objection to an adjournment,
      or to the course of procedure proposed, to which he answered that he had
      not; whereupon the court adjourned the case for two days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days after, the parties again appeared before the court The plaintiff
      now produced his original books of entry, and both he and his clerk swore
      that they were such. The clerk swore that he had sold to, and forwarded
      to, Mr. S. every article charged upon the books. Mr. G. swore that he had
      seen many of the articles in Mr. S.'s store-room on the day he first
      arrived in Alexandria; that the account was due and overdue; and that no
      part thereof had been paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. T. was then called upon by the court to make any defence he thought
      proper. He replied that he had no defence to make, further than the Judge
      already knew, that every fact and every argument within his reach had been
      stated and made at the interview had at the headquarters. He added, that
      the attorney which Mr. S. had been in the habit of employing before he
      left Alexandria was in the court-room, and that he had tried to induce him
      to take charge of and conduct the case, but this he had declined to do, as
      he was not prepared to take the oath of allegiance to the United States
      government, required by the court from all attorneys who would practise in
      it He had not had opportunity to confer with Mr. S., by letter or
      otherwise, since these proceedings commenced, nor did he know that he
      should have for a long time to come, else he might ask for an adjournment
      of the case until he could hear from him. Under all the circumstances he
      saw no other way than to submit to the judgment of the court, whatever it
      might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      All parties having rested, Judge Freese said he "would have much preferred
      not to take up this class of cases, but under all the circumstances it was
      a responsibility he could not avoid. The plaintiff came to this city
      seeking his debtor and the recovery of a just claim. Upon inquiry he
      learns that his debtor has fled and is now within the enemy's lines, yea,
      even under the very wings and protection of the authorities at Richmond.
      He cannot pursue him thither, nor can he issue, or have issued, any
      process by which to compel his return. The goods he sold him, however,
      with a large amount of other goods, he finds in Alexandria, in possession
      of a man who claims to be Mr. S.'s agent for the care and sale of his
      goods, but not his agent for the payment of his debts. Indeed, this
      so-called agent&mdash;who, in a legal sense, is no agent at all, and has
      no more claim upon the goods than any other gentleman in this court-room&mdash;even
      goes so far as to say that 'Mr. S. may not owe this plaintiff anything
      now, however justly he may have, owed him a few months ago, for the reason
      that the Confederate Congress has since then passed a law sequestrating
      all debts due from the South to the North; in reply to which the court
      told him, and may now repeat for the benefit of this whole community, that
      it matters not what laws may or may not be passed by the Confederate
      Congress, they can in no way affect the people of this city so long as it
      remains in charge of Union troops, and that is likely to be so long as the
      war continues. Had there been any other tribunal in this city to which
      this class of cases could have been referred, this court would not have
      taken them up; but, since the State and county courts of Alexandria had
      virtually run away when the people ran away, the simple question to decide
      was, whether this court should take up this class of cases, in addition to
      such as it had already taken up, or allow Mr. G., and others like him, to
      be without any remedy whatever? Viewed from this standpoint, it became a
      duty, a responsibility, and one which the court could not avoid, without
      inflicting great injury upon others and consequent blame upon itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With regard to the facts in the present case there is not a shadow of
      doubt in the mind of the court, nor is it at all probable that Mr. S.
      would deny any one of them, if here himself. He unquestionably owes this
      debt to Mr. G.; the goods in the store-room which he lately occupied
      unquestionably belong to Mr. S.; Mr. T. has no claim upon them whatever,
      not even the claim of an agent or clerk, in a legal sense; he has assumed
      authority so far as it suited his own convenience, but declines to assume
      it when it does not suit his convenience or his secession notions; to sell
      the goods, pocket the money, and transmit all or part of it to Richmond
      was, to his mind, all right&mdash;to pay Mr. S.'s creditors with the
      money, or with a portion of the goods, was, to his mind, all wrong. In all
      this the court differs with him entirely, and holds that so much of the
      goods as have not been paid for belong to his creditors rather than to
      him, and that the agent, so soon as he became satisfied of the correctness
      of the claim, should not have hesitated a moment about returning to Mr. G.
      so much of his goods as remained in store, and paid him the balance in
      money or in other goods. It is a principle of law that a consideration of
      some kind must pass from buyer to seller before legal possession can be
      claimed by the buyer. Hence you see in contracts the words, 'For and in
      consideration of one dollar, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged,'
      etc.; whereas no dollar, or any other sum, has passed between the parties,
      and yet these words or their equivalent are necessary in order to make the
      contract legal. It may be answered that the taking of a note, or a consent
      to a charge upon books of regular entry, are regarded as a 'consideration'
      in the mercantile world, and this may be so; but certainly, if the
      purchaser afterwards repudiates his note or book account, or if the
      government under which he has placed himself repudiates the debt for him,
      then there is not, nor has there been, any 'consideration,' and the
      seller, in law as well as in equity, has a right to the goods.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Again: in the eye of the law, Mr. S. would be regarded as an absconded
      debtor, and had there been a court of common pleas in this city, Mr. G.
      could have had an attachment issued, and the goods of Mr. S. seized and
      held by virtue of that attachment. True, Mr. S. has not left the State&mdash;and
      in most of the States the law requires that the party shall have left the
      State before an attachment can issue&mdash;but, under the present state of
      things, Mr. S. has as virtually left the State, or at least the
      jurisdiction of a court in Alexandria, as though he had gone to England. I
      certainly should have taken this view of the case had I been presiding in
      a common pleas court, and this case been brought before me, and I doubt
      not any other judge would have done the same. In law, as in other things,
      'circumstances alter cases,' and it is the duty of a court always to
      consider circumstances, and to give such construction to law as will best
      promote the ends of justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor does this principle at all conflict with another, so often and so
      strongly insisted upon by this court, namely, that abandoned property
      shall not be taken for private gain. Had any party, having no just claim
      upon Mr S., attempted to take for his own use and profit any of the goods
      left by Mr. S. in that store-room, this court, if informed of the attempt,
      would have used all its power to prevent such taking, and, if already
      taken, the court would have made the party return the goods to the place
      from whence taken. But the case in hand is altogether different. Here the
      party has a claim, a just claim, indeed an implied, if not a legal
      ownership in the goods which he seeks to take, and, instead of preventing,
      it becomes the duty of the court to assist in the transfer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, again, it may be said by some&mdash;and is probably thought, if not
      said, by this defendant and his secession friends&mdash;that, as this is a
      military court, it has not, and should not presume to have, any
      jurisdiction in civil matters, or matters touching the transfer of
      property, real or personal. As heretofore stated, this court surely would
      not have assumed any such jurisdiction, had there been a circuit,
      district, common pleas, or chancery court in this city, to which cases of
      this kind could have been referred; but, as all present well know, there
      has been no such court here since the Confederate troops left, and with
      them all the officers of State and county courts. Hence, as before stated,
      it was this court or nothing. But there is a view, and a very strong view,
      of the case, in which it would become not only the right, but the duty, of
      this court, or of any military court, to interfere in cases of this kind,
      namely, where it became known that property, or the proceeds from sales of
      property, was being surreptitiously transferred from the hands of friends
      to the hands of enemies. The third section of the third article of the
      Constitution of the United States defines treason to be the 'levying of
      war against the United States, or in adhering to their enemies, <i>giving
      them aid and comfort</i>.' Now, if the transfer of goods, or the transfer
      of money from the sale of goods, gives to an enemy 'aid and comfort,'
      then, surely, it is the business of a military court to stop it, and the
      evidence in this case shows this to have been done. The agent admits that
      he has sold the goods for cash in hand whenever he had opportunity, and
      that, as he has had opportunity, he has transmitted the money to Mr. S.;
      nor does he, or any other of his friends, pretend to deny that Mr. S. is
      an avowed enemy to the government which this court, in part, represents.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So suddenly and so unexpectedly has this new class of cases come upon the
      court, that no time has been had to consult with the Attorney-General or
      other legal gentlemen, or even to consult legal authorities with regard to
      the matter; but the court has no doubt that the principles laid down in
      every law text-book, including Blackstone, Kent, Parsons, Greenleaf,
      Chitty, Cockburn, Stephen, and others, will fully justify every position
      thus far taken by this court, even though there be not a single precedent
      to cite. While this court would much prefer to follow than to make
      precedents, yet it has no hesitancy in making them when the circumstances
      of a case call for, or justify, such action. At the earliest possible
      moment the court will draw up and promulgate a course of proceedings in
      cases of this character. Until then the form of proceedings and the manner
      of adjudication will have to depend altogether upon the facts in each
      particular case.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The judgment of the court in this case is, that the plaintiff choose one
      man, the defendant another, and the two, a third, or, if there be any
      disagreement about the choice of a third man, that the Provost-Marshal act
      as such third man. That the three thus selected constitute a commission,
      authorized and directed by this court to set apart, of the goods left by
      Mr. S., so much as will pay in full, at a fair valuation, the claim due
      from Mr. S. to Mr. G.; that this commission shall fix the price of every
      article transferred to Mr. G., and, where there is a disagreement as to
      value between the two, the judgment of the third shall be final; that the
      gross amount of goods to be transferred shall include the amount of Mr.
      G.'s claim, the estimated cost of transportation from this city to
      Philadelphia, and five dollars to each of the commissioners for the
      services they will render; that the commissioners make a written report to
      this court so soon as the goods have been selected and set apart; but that
      the goods be not taken from the store-room, until the report of the
      commissioners be approved by this court, and an order for their shipment
      obtained. The Provost-Marshal will see to the execution of this order in
      all its parts."
    </p>
    <p>
      The court then adjourned. On the afternoon of the same day each party
      chose their man, and the Provost-Marshal consented to act as the third.
      Next morning the three went to the store-room, accompanied by Mr. G. and
      Mr. T., and before noon had a sufficient amount of goods selected and set
      apart to cover Mr. G.'s claim. In the afternoon they presented their
      written report to the Provost-judge; he examined and approved it, and at
      once gave an order for the delivery and shipment of the goods. Next day
      they were shipped, and probably a better pleased man never left Alexandria
      than Mr. G.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only other case of this character to which we can give place, occurred
      between a large wholesale dry-goods firm of New York and one of the
      largest retail dry-goods houses in Alexandria, and differed from the first
      case only in the fact that here the store was securely locked up, and had
      been ever since the owners left. There was no agent in this case left to
      sell or otherwise dispose of the goods, though it came out, in the course
      of the evidence, that the clerk, with whom the keys had been left, had
      frequently been seen to take large packages of goods from the store, and
      he acknowledged that he had sent some across the lines to his former
      employers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case, as in the one related, the New York merchant went to
      Alexandria to look after his customers, and found them gone. After
      considerable inquiry, he found the clerk who had the keys, but the clerk
      said he had no authority from the owners to do anything, and would not so
      much as open the store to allow the creditor to look in. The merchant then
      called upon Judge Freese and told him the facts of the case. The Judge
      informed him that the court now had a regular course of procedure in these
      cases, and if he chose to pursue that course he could bring his case
      before the court. The merchant inquired what was the procedure? The Judge
      informed him that the first step was, for the party having a claim to make
      an affidavit as to its amount and its correctness&mdash;the same as in
      cases of attachment in ordinary courts; that thereupon the court issued an
      order, having the force of an attachment, to the Provost-Marshal, to take
      charge of the goods of the defendant until such time as the case could be
      heard&mdash;usually in one week from the day the attachment issued; that
      the plaintiff must then produce his original books of entry, or note, or
      other evidence of debt, and satisfy the court, beyond any possible doubt,
      that the debt is due and unpaid; that when this had been done&mdash;the
      defendant meanwhile, or any one for him, having, of course, full
      opportunity to make any defence within his power, if any he had to make&mdash;the
      court appoints three wholly disinterested persons to fix the value and set
      apart so much of the defendant's goods as would satisfy the claim of the
      plaintiff, with cost of transportation to a market, and costs of
      proceedings; that the three commissioners must then make report, with
      schedule of goods set apart, to the court; that the court carefully
      examines said report, and if found correct in all particulars, then issues
      an order to Provost-Marshal to deliver to plaintiff the goods so set
      apart; upon receipt of which the plaintiff executes receipt to
      Provost-Marshal for the goods, as in full liquidation of his claim against
      the defendant. The proceedings, the Judge said, were so plain that a child
      could understand them, and so open and straightforward, from first to
      last, that a mistake was scarcely possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The merchant expressed his delight at the mode of procedure, as detailed
      by the Judge, and said he was ready to make the preliminary affidavit at
      once, and in a week would return to Alexandria with his books and
      witnesses to substantiate his claim. The Judge drew the necessary
      affidavit; the merchant subscribed and swore thereto; the Provost-Marshal
      was sent for; the order for attaching the goods put into his hands; and
      within one hour from the time when the New York merchant entered the
      Judge's office, guards stood in front and at the rear of the building, to
      see that no goods were taken from the store-room. The young man who had
      the keys was then sent for, and told to write to his employers, and inform
      any friends of his employers who might still be in Alexandria, of just
      what had been done thus far, and that the court had appointed one week
      from that day to hear the case. If they, or any one for them, had any
      defence to make, they should be at the court-room at ten o'clock of that
      day and should then be heard. He thanked the Judge for his courtesy in
      sending for him, and for the timely notice given for defence, and was
      about to retire, when the Judge told him that he might hand the keys over
      to the Provost-Marshal until the case had been disposed of. This he at
      first refused to do, but a few words from the Judge satisfied him that
      wisdom was the better part of valor, when he took the keys from his pocket
      and handed them to the Marshal.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one week the trial came on. The New York merchant, on behalf of his
      firm, appeared with his books and with the clerk who had sold and
      delivered the goods. The defendants were not present, but were represented
      by their clerk, by the secession lawyer of the city, heretofore spoken of,
      and by about a dozen other gentlemen, who were friends, if not relatives,
      of the absconded debtors. The plaintiff proved that the books before the
      court were the original books of entry of the firm of which he was a
      member. By his clerk he proved the sale and delivery of the goods, item by
      item, as charged upon the books. By himself he proved that the debt was
      now due, and that no part of it had ever been paid. The court then asked
      if there was any person present to make a defence in this case, if so,
      they would now be heard. The clerk then arose and said he "was instructed
      by the attorney of the firm to say, that while they had no formal defence
      to make in this case, yet they desired to enter their protest against the
      jurisdiction of this court, and to reserve to and for themselves whatever
      rights they might have under the laws of Virginia." He added, that he
      himself "was aware that the firm, of which he was formerly a clerk, had
      purchased goods of the New York firm represented in this case, and had no
      doubt that the amount they claimed was due them; but that it would have
      been wiser and more honorable in them to have waited until the war was
      over, when they would undoubtedly have been paid dollar for dollar." The
      court inquired if there was any other gentleman present who desired to
      offer any evidence, or say anything by way of defence in this case. There
      was no response.
    </p>
    <p>
      The court then proceeded to give an opinion in the case, which occupied
      nearly an hour, and was listened to with almost breathless silence by the
      large audience present. In amount claimed, and in point of high standing,
      both as to the plaintiffs and defendants, it was the most important case
      of the kind yet brought before the court, and for the information of the
      general public, no less than for the parties immediately interested, the
      Judge thought it well to state the principles upon which the court acted,
      and their applicability to the case in hand. A reporter present wrote out
      the opinion, which, by request of the New York merchant, was published
      soon after in the New York Times, occupying over two columns of closely
      printed matter. As most of the principles enunciated in this opinion were
      the same as stated in the first case heretofore given, it is not necessary
      to repeat them here. In reply to the clerk's request "to reserve to and
      for themselves whatever rights they might have under the laws of
      Virginia," and to the opinion expressed by him that "the New York firm
      would have acted wiser and more honorable to have waited for their claim
      until the war was over," the court said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, in this, as in every other case, the parties can and do
      reserve for themselves whatever rights they possess under the laws of
      Virginia, of which this city forms a part, and, if the rebellion succeeds,
      the parties reserving these rights will undoubtedly make the best use of
      them possible; but meanwhile the claimants, so far as this court can
      effect it, shall have a return of their own goods, or of others equal in
      value to their claim, and after that, if the debtors, through
      sequestration laws made by the Confederate Congress, or any laws now made
      or hereafter to be made by Virginia, can get the goods back or damages by
      way of reclamation, this court at least will have done its duty. With
      regard to the opinion expressed by the young gentleman, the court begs to
      differ with him. By his own confession portions of the goods have already
      been sent across the lines, and to that extent have contributed to the
      'aid and comfort' of the enemies of this government, and had there been no
      claimants, no interference, there is no manner of doubt that every article
      in the store would, sooner or later, have gone the same way; and as to the
      debtors paying the claim after the war is over, if we may judge by what
      they and their chosen government have already done, there is no more
      probability of it than for the waters of Niagara Falls to run backwards.
      As the leap of the waters in that case is irrevocable, so is the leap from
      the fair haven of loyalty to the deep, dark chasm of disloyalty&mdash;once
      taken, there can be no hope of return." One other matter the court
      explained in this case, which was not explained in the first, namely, why
      the goods were not sold at public sale, and the money, instead of the
      goods, turned over to claimants. He said: "It will be observed that by the
      rules of procedure adopted in these cases, the court is quite as careful
      to protect the interests of debtors as of claimants. In ordinary actions
      for debt, in courts of common pleas, the goods, after being attached or
      levied upon, are put up at public sale and sold to the highest bidder, and
      the money received at such sales paid to claimants. In such cases it often
      happens that, even in a market, goods do not bring one-half and sometimes
      not one-fourth their real value, and the defendant of course has to suffer
      the loss. If the goods seized here were thus exposed to public sale, at
      this time, when two-thirds of its ordinary inhabitants have fled from the
      city, and when there is little or no market for anything outside of army
      stores, they would not bring one-fourth their cost; whereas the same goods
      taken to a market, will sell for about their original cost. Hence the rule
      in the proceedings whereby goods are assessed by three disinterested
      persons, and turned over to the claimants at the prices fixed by the
      commissioners. And the court begs to add&mdash;though not boastfully,
      since it only performs a duty in so doing&mdash;that, because of the
      absence of the defendants, doubly the care is taken that the full market
      value is fixed to each article turned over to the creditor; and that in
      every case the court carefully supervises the schedules, to see that no
      mistakes have been made.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the goods were sold at a public sale, the court could in no way
      control the price, and a debtor's goods might be sold for one-half or
      one-fourth of their real value; but by this procedure the debtor is sure
      to receive about the fair value of the goods. The fact that the debtor is
      absent (although a rebel to the government which this court in part
      represents) makes us all the more careful to see that he shall have exact
      justice; for, in all these cases, this court recognizes the principles so
      ably stated by Bouvier, by Blackburn, and by others who have written on
      the law of sales&mdash;1. That 'to constitute a sale, there must be a
      price, which is the consideration given for the purchase of a thing.' 2.
      That 'the price must be serious, or such a one as the seller intends to
      require to be paid to him. As to the quantum of the price, that is
      altogether immaterial, unless there has been fraud in the transaction.' 3.
      That 'the price must be certain and determined, but upon the maxim, id
      certum est quod reddi cerium potest, a sale may be valid, although it is
      agreed that the price of the thing sold shall be determined by a third
      person! 4. That 'the price must consist in a sum of money which the buyer
      agrees to pay to the seller; for, if it be paid in any other way, the
      contract is not a sale, but an exchange or barter. But it is only
      requisite that the agreement should be for a payment in money; in the
      sequel it may be changed, and the creditor may take goods in payment, and
      the contract will still be a sale. It is not requisite that the money
      should be paid down, either at the time of the sale or the delivery of the
      goods; it may be upon a credit, or payable at a future time. And, 5. That
      the consent of the contracting parties must be obtained; by which consent
      is meant an agreement to something proposed. It does not consist simply in
      a vague will to sell or to pay; it must bear on all the conditions which
      may be suggested by the circumstances of the case or imagined by the
      caprice of the contracting parties.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case, as in others, the court fixed upon the amount due the
      claimants, appointed three commissioners to select and assess values to
      goods to the amount of claim, supervised the report and schedule made,
      gave order to the Provost-Marshal to deliver the goods; all of which was
      done, and the New York merchant returned to his home, with the full
      conviction that in one city at least, and in one court at least, justice
      was administered without partiality, and without fear or favor of, or to,
      any one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only was the Judge's decision in this case published, as heretofore
      stated, in the New York journals, but the newspapers all over the country
      had more or less to say about it editorially&mdash;some favorable and some
      unfavorable&mdash;the particulars of which and the results of which will
      be more fully stated in the next chapter.

      ACT IN THE DRAMA.&mdash;PRIDE ON THE ONE SIDE AND JUSTICE ON THE OTHER
      PROMPTING THE ACTORS.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HERE is nothing so
      uncommon as common sense; nor is there anything more distasteful than
      common sense to such as pride themselves on technical knowledge. The
      doctor who would rather kill by rule than cure by reason, if the reason
      chanced to come from a sick-nurse, or from an old woman; and the lawyer
      who would rather lose a case by observing technicalities and following
      precedents, than gain it by exercising plain common sense, are by no means
      so rare as some suppose. They are to be found in all the walks of life,
      high as well as low, and whenever or wherever found, should be carefully
      noted, especially by the historian, in order to warn others from falling
      into a like error.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the very day the provost-court opened in Alexandria, the
      secessionists of that city, and all whom they could influence in
      Washington and elsewhere, commenced to oppose it&mdash;not so much openly
      as secretly. This was especially true of the only lawyer remaining there,
      and his reasons for opposition were of a threefold character. First, he
      saw it might, and probably would be used in the interests of the Union
      cause and in the cause of freedom, and thus interfere with the plans of
      secessionists and of slave-owners; secondly, he opposed it because the
      court refused to admit him, or any other lawyer, to practise in it, unless
      they would first take the oath of allegiance to the United States
      government; and thirdly, because the court was presided over by one who
      was not a professional lawyer; by one who seemed to have more regard for
      justice and equity than for legal technicalities; by one who cared nothing
      about the laws of Virginia, or law precedents of any State, if one or the
      other stood in the way of justice; by one who preferred to be guided by
      the rules of common sense, rather than by the rules of law. To one who is
      not a professional man himself, all this may seem strange; but to one who
      has mingled much with professional men, it will be readily understood as
      comprehending cases which have fallen under his own observation. On the
      pretence of protecting the people, though really to protect their own
      selfish interests, both doctors and lawyers have procured the passage of
      laws in many States, whereby no one is authorized to practise in either
      profession until he shall have complied with such rules and regulations as
      these laws prescribe. It is virtually a relinquishment by the people of
      one of the very first principles of freedom&mdash;namely, the right to
      choose their own agents or servants, but it is submitted to on the plea
      that it keeps out quacks and pettifoggers. If, while keeping these out, it
      imparted more of common sense to those taken in, it would be at least
      compensating in its operations, but it does neither.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was observed that immediately after the court fined that secessionist
      five hundred dollars for assault and threat to kill the Unionist (an
      account of which has heretofore been given), the Alexandria lawyer became
      doubly active in his opposition to the court, and it was stated, as a
      reason for his greatly increased activity, that the hardware merchant had
      agreed to give the five hundred dollars as a fee to the lawyer, provided
      he could get it back, and procure an order from General McClellan, or from
      the authorities at Washington, to suppress the court. To effect this
      object the Alexandria lawyer applied to every prominent secessionist at
      Washington, and got from each the promise to bring to bear whatever
      influence he could, through Northern sympathizers. He went himself,
      personally, to every lawyer in Washington, and appealed to each to protect
      the "honor of their profession," by assisting to suppress a court which
      had no legal existence, or, at least, to remove from its head one who was
      not a lawyer, but a doctor, by profession. Even several Union lawyers were
      moved to activity by this plea for "protection to the profession," while
      secession lawyers were ready enough to make this, or anything else, a plea
      whereby to cripple the government.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came to the ears of Judge Freese that some of these professedly Union,
      but really disloyal, lawyers had gone direct to President Lincoln and
      urged him, both as President and as a lawyer, to issue an order to
      suppress the Alexandria court, or, at least, direct the removal of the
      "doctor-judge." The reply, as reported by one who chanced to be present,
      was characteristic of President Lincoln, and in about the following words:
      "I have known Dr. Freese as a first-class physician for some years, and
      have only known of him as a judge for a few months: but from the way he
      administers law-doses to these Alexandrians, I am beginning to think that
      he is even a better judge than he is a doctor. He may not understand legal
      technicalities and the rules of courts quite as well as some lawyers I
      know of&mdash;present company, of course, always excepted&mdash;but he
      shows in his decisions a wonderful deal of common sense, which is far
      better than rules of law or technicalities. What they say of the doctor
      reminds me of a story which is told of a man who said he could not cure
      chills and fever, but was 'death on fits,' and wanted all his patients to
      have fits, when he would cure them at once. Most of our lawyers and judges
      are death on technicalities, but can't cure the commonest ills to which
      society is subjected; whereas, Dr. Freese is curing the ills of Alexandria
      so rapidly and so successfully, that it will soon be one of the most
      healthy and one of the most thoroughly Union cities in the whole country'.
      I would not interfere with him or his court for the world, and don't think
      any one else should."
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding that they could make no impression upon the President, they next
      went to the Secretary of War, Simon Cameron. He listened to all they had
      to say, and then replied about as follows: "Yes, I've heard considerable
      about Freese's 'Bayonet Court,' as secessionists and Northern sympathizers
      with secession call it, and the more I've heard of it the better I like
      it. I only wish we had just such a court, and just such a judge at the
      head of it, in every city we've conquered from the rebels. They would do
      more towards extracting the venom of these secession serpents than all our
      armies combined. As to the Judge being a doctor, instead of a lawyer, by
      profession, that only makes me think the more of him. A lawyer is
      anybody's man who'll pay him a fee, and the one who'll pay the best is apt
      to get from him the best service, no matter on which side he pretends to
      be employed, but a doctor has only to cure the case in hand, and can have
      no conflicting interests; and from the way Judge Freese is pulling out the
      teeth of those secession scoundrels, by taking from them the means to do
      harm and transferring it to the pockets of those to whom it justly
      belongs, and who will use it to sustain the Union cause, I am satisfied
      that he is just the man for the place, and on no account would I do
      anything to suppress either him or his court."
    </p>
    <p>
      Their next applications were to the Attorney-General, Edward Bates, of
      Missouri, and Postmaster-General Montgomery Blair, of Maryland. Here they
      struck chords which were much more likely to prove responsive&mdash;not
      only because they each had been pro-slavery men all their lives, and would
      naturally resent Judge Freese's interference with the "institution," and
      with those who still claimed the right to hold and to use "human chattels"
      just as they pleased, but, more especially, because they were both
      lawyers, both felt a special interest in maintaining the "<i>dignity</i>
      of the profession" for both expected to return to active practice so soon
      as they vacated their then official positions in Mr. Lincoln's cabinet.
      Mr. Bates took up the matter with great earnestness so soon as it was
      fairly before him, and, within one hour from the time the self-constituted
      committee left him, he was with the President, urging him to suppress the
      court. When Mr. Lincoln had expressed his opinions concerning it, Mr.
      Bates, for the time being, seemed entirely nonplussed; but next day he
      returned to the attack with renewed energy, and for days and weeks after
      that, whenever he met the President, he had something to say against the
      Alexandria provost-court. Mr. Blair also spoke to the President concerning
      it, and strongly contended that it would greatly aid the Union cause,
      "especially in the <i>border</i> States," if that court were suppressed.
      The President did not think so, and would give no such order.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these efforts were being made with the President and with the
      Cabinet, corresponding efforts were being made with General McClellan,
      then in command of the troops on the south side of the Potomac. Within a
      week or two from the opening of the court, one of the General's aids
      called upon General Montgomery to make inquiry about it, and several times
      after that this same aid (whom the Union men of Alexandria knew personally
      as a pro-slavery Washington sympathizer with the rebellion, though
      professedly a Union man) called upon General Montgomery to protest against
      the acts of the court, so far as they related to the people of Alexandria.
      Whether always sent by General McClellan, or whether he sometimes called
      on his own volition, was not definitely known. The Alexandria secession
      lawyer seemed to be on intimate personal relations with this aid-de-camp,
      and it may have been that this personal relationship stirred up the aid to
      special efforts. Doubtless the lawyer kept the aid, and, through the aid,
      General McClellan, well-informed of all that was going on in Alexandria&mdash;especially
      with regard to the doings of the provost court.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus matters had gone on, and were going on, up to the time when the last
      case recorded in the previous chapter was decided by the court. The
      publicity given to that case, by the publication at length of the Judge's
      opinion in the New York Times and other Northern papers, aroused the
      entire pro-slavery secession-sympathizing element of the Northern States,
      and in a few days thereafter it came surging into Washington like a flood.
      It beat against the door of every Cabinet officer; it rolled and tumbled
      about in every hotel and drinking-saloon; it surged violently against the
      White House; and even found its way into the executive chamber. Mr. Bates
      now put on renewed and increased vigor, and insisted with the President,
      that, as all United States courts belonged to his department, and the
      people held him responsible, as Attorney-General, for their doings and
      misdoings, he, and he alone, ought to have the deciding of the Alexandria
      matter, and, if left with him, he would at once suppress the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      When things had reached this crisis, the President sent word to Judge
      Freese to call upon him at his earliest convenience. The Judge, after
      being stationed at Alexandria, had, during the first few months, called
      frequently upon President Lincoln, Secretary Seward, and Secretary
      Cameron, as he had known them all personally, and somewhat intimately, for
      many years; but for the month preceding this word from the President, the
      Judge had been kept so exceedingly busy with the affairs of his court that
      he had scarcely been to Washington. On the afternoon of the next day after
      getting Mr. Lincoln's message, Judge Freese called upon him, and was
      received with the utmost cordiality. So soon as they were entirely alone,
      the President told the Judge of the position which Attorney-General Bates
      had taken with reference to the Alexandria court, and added: "I really
      think Bates will resign unless he can have his own way in this thing. I
      wish, Doctor, you would call upon him at once, and see if you can't change
      his mind. It would be a dreadful thing, just now, when we are in the midst
      of a war, to have any Cabinet officer resign, as our enemies would regard
      it as showing weakness on our part, and as a triumph for themselves, and
      yet I don't want your court closed, if it can possibly be helped. Call
      upon Bates, Doctor, call upon Bates, and let me know the result."
    </p>
    <p>
      From the President's room the Judge went direct to Mr. Bates's office and
      had a long conference with him. The Attorney-General, while admitting the
      correctness of Judge Freese's decisions, so far as he had heard of them,
      still insisted that there was no law by which the existence of such a
      court was authorized, and therefore it ought to cease its operations at
      once. The Judge admitted that he knew of no law by which such a court was
      authorized, but contended that "necessity knew no law," and that the
      existence of just such a court was a real necessity in Alexandria, not
      only as a means of preserving the peace of the city, but for all other
      purposes for which courts were ever used, since the State, county, and
      municipal courts had all run away when the Union troops came in, and this
      was the only court through which justice could be obtained in any case or
      for any purpose. All this, the Attorney-General said, seemed to be true,
      but it was better to wait for justice than to violate known rules of law
      in trying to obtain it. "The court has no legal existence, sir, the court
      has no legal existence," he kept saying over and over again, and this was
      his answer, and his only answer, to every argument brought forth by the
      Judge. The Judge finally made him this proposition: "If you, sir, will
      withdraw your opposition to the continuance of this court, I will enter
      into a bond with the United States government, in the sum of one hundred
      thousand dollars, with good and sufficient sureties, the condition of
      which bond shall be, that, when the war shall have ended, every case which
      has been adjudicated by that court, and every one which may be adjudicated
      by it hereafter, shall be revised by the Supreme Court of the United
      States, or by any one or more of the justices thereof, and if in any case
      it be found that injustice has been done, I will refund to the parties
      doubly the amount out of which they have been wronged because of the
      action of the court; or, if any punishment has been inflicted beyond what
      the Supreme Court will say was right, under the circumstances, I will pay
      to the party punished, or to his legal representatives, whatever damages
      the Supreme Court may adjudge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This, certainly," replied the Attorney-General, "is a very fair
      proposition on your part; but, sir, the court has no legal existence, no
      legal existence, and while I remain Attorney-General, and am responsible
      for whatever is done in this department of governmental affairs, I cannot
      consent that such a court shall continue."
    </p>
    <p>
      This ended their interview, for the Judge plainly saw that he might talk
      till doomsday and yet not change the Attorney-General's mind an iota.
      "Convince a man against his will, and he remains of the same opinion
      still," says an old maxim, and never was the maxim better exemplified than
      in the case of Mr. Bates. He was one of those men who looked at
      everything, as it were, through a gun-barrel, and could see nothing to the
      right or left of the one line of vision; one of those men who are so
      straight, that, like the Indian's gun, they "lean a little over;" one of
      those self opinionated men, who, having once conceived an idea or
      prejudice, no amount of argument can change his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day the Judge again called upon the President, and told him all
      that had passed between the Attorney-General and himself. The President
      laughed heartily at the "mulishness of old Bates," as he called it, and
      yet seemed a good deal annoyed at the unreasonable stubbornness manifested
      by the Attorney-General. He did not, he said, know what to do or to say.
      He was in a quandary, and could not see his way clearly out. Finally, he
      asked the Judge to call upon the Secretary of War, and see what he might
      say about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge then called upon Mr. Cameron, and told him of the interviews he
      had had with the President and with the Attorney-General, relative to the
      Alexandria court. The Secretary listened attentively, and, when the Judge
      had finished, expressed opinions about the Attorney-General more forcible
      than polite. He talked, he said, "just like a d&mdash;d old traitor, and
      if he is not one, his own tongue belies him!" He strongly suspected, he
      said, that "both Bates and Blair were wolves in sheep's clothing, and this
      only went to confirm that opinion." He had, he said, "expressed as much to
      the President, and would do so again when next he met him." He had thought
      himself of resigning, rather than remain in the Cabinet in company "with
      such d&mdash;d rascals and traitors to their country." For a full
      half-hour the Secretary fairly raved with excitement, and when the Judge
      was about to leave, told him to hold on, let come what would.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this connection it may be well to add that within a few weeks after
      that interview Mr. Cameron did resign his place in the cabinet, and Mr. E.
      M. Stanton was appointed in his stead; but whether Bates's action in the
      case of the Alexandria court was one of his reasons for resigning, we have
      no means of knowing, though it Is not at all improbable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the Judge called upon the President, and told him what had passed
      between Secretary Cameron and himself. The President seemed now more
      confounded than ever, and finally told the Judge to let things rest for a
      few days until he could think over the matter, and see what was best to be
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a week after this, the aid-de-camp of General McClellan, who had so
      often before called upon General Montgomery, called again, and told him
      that it was General McClellan's special wish that the provost-court should
      have nothing more to do with civil cases, or cases touching the subject of
      slavery in any way. That while General McClellan greatly preferred not to
      issue a formal order on the subject, yet he would certainly do so if his
      wishes could not be carried out in any other way. He was not willing, the
      aid said, to have Judge Freese interfere with the old citizens of
      Alexandria in any way, though if he chose to continue the court merely for
      the punishment of soldiers who got drunk within the city limits, or
      otherwise disturbed the peace, he had no objection. At the same visit, the
      aid delivered to General Montgomery an order from General McClellan
      requiring the court to refund to the Alexandria hardware merchant the five
      hundred dollars which he had been required to pay as a fine, because of
      the assault, with threat to kill, upon the Union man&mdash;all of which
      has heretofore been related.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the aid had gone, General Montgomery sent for Judge Freese, and they
      had a long conference as to what had best be done under the circumstances.
      The Judge had before told the General all that had passed between the
      President, the Attorney-General, the Secretary of War, and himself; and
      the General now told the Judge all that had passed between General
      McClellan's aid-de-camp and himself. The Judge said that under no
      circumstances could he consent to continue the court, if thenceforth it
      was only to punish soldiers for drunkenness and other misdemeanors; that
      it had been exceedingly distasteful to him from the first to have to
      punish a soldier at all, and now to punish him alone, and let citizens,
      who committed offences far worse, go free from punishment, would be, in
      his opinion, a mockery of justice, and he would not be the presiding
      officer of such a court; that, it having gone abroad that the court was
      willing and ready to assist Northern creditors in their efforts to collect
      claims against disloyal debtors, it would now be exceedingly unpleasant to
      have to deny such claimants as might thereafter call, and, rather than
      have to do this, he would much prefer to see the court closed; for then
      the public would place the responsibility just where it belonged. The
      Judge added, that he knew the court was placing the President in a very
      embarrassing position, so far as related to his Cabinet; that, while
      Cameron and Seward were anxious to have the court continue, Bates and
      Blair were just as anxious to have it suppressed; and from the order just
      received from General McClellan to return the five hundred dollars fine,
      it was entirely clear that the secessionists of Alexandria, and the
      sympathizers with secession at the North, had gained complete control over
      him; from all of which the Judge thought it would be best to close the
      court.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Montgomery fully concurred with the Judge in all these views, and
      added that, as the court had been organized upon his order, without first
      consulting with General McClellan or the President, he would much prefer
      to have it close voluntarily, than to be compelled to close it upon the
      order of General McClellan or of the President. The Judge replied, that
      while he believed that President Lincoln would never issue such an order,
      no matter what the consequences to himself might be, still he should be
      glad to relieve the President from what to him was evidently a great
      embarrassment; and if he, General Montgomery, would issue an order
      directing the court to close its operations on the next or any day
      following, he, the Judge, would gladly announce the order from the bench
      and adjourn the court <i>sine die.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the conclusion finally agreed upon. General Montgomery wrote out
      the necessary order and handed it to the Judge. Next day, after all the
      business before the court had been disposed of as usual, the Judge read
      General Montgomery's order from the bench, and explained to those present
      why it had been issued. Had a cannon burst then and there and killed a
      hundred men, the surprise could not have been greater. Some raved at
      Attorney-General Bates, and pro-slavery men generally; others cursed
      General McClellan and Northern sympathizers with rebellion, generally;
      deep and somewhat loud were the mutterings among all present; but the
      order was irrevocable, and thus closed at once and forever the
      provost-court of Alexandria.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had that court been continued, and others like it established in every
      city of the South, so soon as they came into the possession of Union
      troops, at least one hundred millions of dollars would have been collected
      from the property of Southern debtors and gone into the pockets of
      Northern creditors; the war would have ended two years sooner; over five
      hundred millions of dollars would have been saved to the United States
      treasury; and over one hundred thousand lives been saved to the homes and
      families of both the North and the South. Only at the last judgment-day
      will it be known how great was the mistake&mdash;a mistake which, in its
      ultimate consequences, was not less ruinous to the South than to the North&mdash;of
      those who insisted upon, and who finally compelled, the closing of the
      provost-court at Alexandria.
    </p>
    <p>
      We say this after a full consideration of the whole subject as drawn from
      the facts heretofore detailed in this volume, and do not think we shall
      have to take a single word of it back. True, very true, as eloquently
      stated in a letter from our old friend, J. E. Brush, Esq., of New York&mdash;"Floyd,
      Thompson, and Cobb, of Buchanan's Cabinet, had so disarmed and depleted
      the government of means, that Lincoln had very slender resources; and the
      gullibility of Northern business men in filling the orders of Southern men
      for war material, for months previous to the opening of the war, proves
      that they meant business, while the North did not take in the situation at
      all;" still we think, but for the secret machinations of Northern
      sympathizers&mdash;of men on whom, for a time, the government relied and
      entirely trusted, including generals in the field, officers in the navy,
      and even officers in the Cabinet&mdash;the war would have been ended at
      least two years sooner, and hundreds of millions saved to the taxpayers of
      the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are aware that such a statement at first sight seems extravagant, if
      not wild; but if the reader will carefully weigh each factor of the
      problem, and follow out the relation which each bears to the other; and
      then if he will suspend judgment until he shall have read the last chapter
      and last line of this book&mdash;so that he shall have all the facts
      before him, all the secret springs which were so adroitly worked, but of
      which nobody even suspected the existence, all the villanies of men singly
      and of men united in political and religious associations&mdash;we have no
      doubt at all but what he will reach the same conclusion that we have
      reached in the above paragraph. Facts and figures never lie when properly
      placed; but men are so disposed to shut their eyes against unpleasant
      facts, and so inclined to place figures in such a way as will bring the
      result they wish for, that the most palpable truths are often hid, and
      kept hid, from the public, until by some accident or incident the secrets
      are revealed, as in this volume.

      CHAPTER XVII. FACTS, FIGURES, AND FAIR INFERENCES.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN, on the 15th
      of April, 1861, Abraham Lincoln, as President of the United States, called
      for 75,000 men, for three months, to suppress the rebellion, he did it
      after repeated consultations with every member of his Cabinet, both when
      assembled in council and privately with each individual member. That
      Cabinet was one of the ablest, if not the very ablest, that any President
      of the United States ever had about him. William H. Seward had been
      Governor of New York, had long been United States Senator, and understood
      the strength and resources of each individual State, and of the whole
      Union, as well, probably, as any man then living. Salmon P. Chase had been
      Governor of Ohio, long a United States Senator, was a thorough
      statistician, mathematician, and financier, and had made the resources of
      both States and nation a long and faithful study. Simon Cameron had been a
      statistician and banker nearly his whole life, had long been a United
      States Senator, was a man of unusually strong common sense, and had, from
      a political stand-point, made the Southern States and their peculiar
      institutions and resources a special study. Wells and Smith were good,
      strong, practical-sensed men; while Blair and Bates were both Southern
      men, were thoroughly conversant with the institutions, with the leading
      men, with the wealth, and with the resources of every Southern State.
    </p>
    <p>
      One would have thought the combined wisdom of such a body of men as near
      perfection, as near certainty in political prophecy, as it was possible
      for men to attain, when judging of the future by inferences drawn from
      actual knowledge of the past and present; and yet, subsequent events
      proved that never were men wider from the mark than were these men in
      advising the President to call out 75,000 men for three months to subdue
      the rebellion. Why this great error of calculation and judgment?
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who have carefully read the preceding chapters of this book will
      have the answer, in part, but not the whole answer. Of course, President
      Lincoln and his Cabinet thoroughly understood the sympathy which existed
      between English cotton-spinners and American cotton-growers, and, in their
      calculations, made due allowance for this feeling. They also understood
      thoroughly the sympathy existing between the aristocracy of England and
      king cotton of America; for they well knew that the aristocracy of England
      were largely the owners of those cotton-mills or furnished the capital
      with which to run them. For this, then, they also made due allowance in
      all their calculations; and, with a view to checkmate this influence as
      far as possible, sent Thurlow Weed on a secret mission to England. They
      understood the business relations of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company
      with the Southern States, as well as the relations of other incorporated
      companies, and of merchants generally, with the South. They knew of the
      debt that was then owing&mdash;nearly two hundred millions of dollars&mdash;from
      Southern merchants to Northern merchants, and fully comprehended the
      sympathy which such community of interests would naturally create between
      the parties; and for all this made due allowance. They understood, of
      course, the love of gain natural to every man, and that merchants,
      manufacturers, and others, by the thousands, would be on the constant
      lookout to make money out of the war in any possible way commensurate with
      their own safety; and for this made due allowance in their calculations as
      to what was to be overcome. And last, but not least, they well understood
      the general sympathy which was felt by the Democratic party of the North
      for the people and peculiar institutions of the South, and how ready some
      of the leaders of that party would be to aid the South in any way they
      could with safety to themselves; but they also understood that a very
      large number of the followers of the masses&mdash;of the bone and sinew of
      that party&mdash;were patriotic; while another portion, and a very large
      portion, would be ready to hire themselves to do whatever would pay best,
      and that if large monthly pay and large bounties were offered, these men
      would be as ready to hire themselves to kill their fellow-men as to
      slaughter cattle; and with these two elements (the patriotic and the
      mercenary), they believed the party could be so far controlled as to
      prevent it from doing any material injury to the Union cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while comprehending all these things, and making due allowance for
      them all, they did not comprehend nor make allowance for the deep-seated,
      desperate, condemnable villany that was hid away in the hearts of these
      same Democratic leaders, and that would come forth from its hiding-places
      whenever and wherever it could do so with the hope of gain to itself, or
      with the hope of so crippling the Union cause that it would finally fail,
      when the affairs of the government would again fall into the hands of the
      Democratic party.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not comprehend, nor was it possible for any human foresight to
      have conceived any one of the many secret devices recorded in the
      preceding chapters of this volume, whereby men could and would serve the
      rebellion in the guise of Unionism; whereby men would, while playing the
      patriot, really be the most desperate rebels At heart; whereby men could,
      while receiving pay as generals in the Union army, do acts whereby
      millions of dollars were lost to loyal merchants; whereby transportation
      companies would, through its leading officers, while receiving large pay
      from the United States government for services legitimately rendered, be
      all the while aiding the rebellion by furnishing ships and money with
      which to exchange cotton for war materials and army supplies; whereby, in
      a word, the Democratic party, as a party would so exercise its influence
      that vice disguised would seem virtue personified; that the promise of a
      candidacy to the office of President would so change the heart and
      paralyze the arm of a Union general as to make him favor the rebel cause
      by delays, and by transferring (through the closing of a provost-court)
      the sinews of war (millions of dollars) from Union pockets to rebel
      coffers; that steamship companies, while receiving the protection of Union
      arms, would be all the while aiding the rebel cause; and that men,
      otherwise regarded as honorable, high-minded gentlemen, would, because of
      old political prejudice and present gain, meet in secret conclaves in New
      York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, and then and there concoct
      the most desperate measures in aid of rebellion. These were secrets which
      no human eye could penetrate, exigencies against which no human foresight
      could provide, and hence it cannot be said in truth that these men failed
      in judgment, since they only failed upon points which were entirely
      outside of all human calculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for these things, three months' service of 75,000 men would have been
      amply sufficient to crush the rebellion, and from this we draw our first
      inference&mdash;which no one can pronounce otherwise than fair&mdash;that
      whatever time it took beyond three months to crush the rebellion, whatever
      men it took beyond 75,000, whatever money it cost beyond the pay of 75,000
      for three months, together with collateral expenses for the same time, and
      whatever lives it cost beyond what would have been the probable mortality
      among the 75,000, are chargeable, fairly chargeable, unquestionably
      chargeable, to the Democratic party as a party. We are careful to say as a
      party, for we know many individuals of that party who are as honorable, as
      pure, as patriotic as any in the Republican party, and who only continue
      their connection with that party (for they know its past sins and present
      corruptions quite as well as we do) either because their fathers were
      Democrats' and they do not wish to be regarded as "turn-coats," or because
      they think the chances of political preferment are better in the
      Democratic than in the Republican party; or, as they have sometimes
      replied to us, half in jest and half in earnest, "the more corrupt the
      party is as a party, the greater necessity is there to have some good men
      remain in it, to prevent it from doing greater injury to the country."
    </p>
    <p>
      As historian, and as readers searching after truth, our next inquiry will
      naturally be&mdash;First. How much more time did it take to subdue the
      rebellion? Second. How many more men did it take? Third. How much
      additional did it cost? Fourth. How many additional lives were sacrificed?
      All these we regard as properly belonging to "Secrets of the Late
      Rebellion, now Revealed for the First Time," for the reason that no one
      heretofore has ever made researches in this particular direction, and
      while the facts have existed ever since they came into being (just as the
      continent of America existed long before Columbus discovered it), yet they
      have never until now been revealed to the public in the relations and
      connections to which they historically belong.
    </p>
    <p>
      I. Though both North and South had been making preparations months before,
      the actual beginning of open war may be dated from the firing upon Fort
      Sumter, on the 12th of April, 1861. The close of the war may be reckoned
      from the surrender of General Lee to General Grant, at Appomattox
      Court-House, on April 9th, 1865, though it was months after before all the
      volunteer troops were disbanded and had reached their homes. From the
      firing on Fort Sumter to the surrender was three years, eleven months, and
      twenty-eight days; or, to make the calculation still finer, from the
      calling out of the seventy-five thousand troops to Lee's surrender was
      three years, eleven months, and twenty-five days. Now, deduct from this
      three months, and you have the extra time consumed in crushing the
      rebellion, every month, every week, and every day of which is justly
      chargeable to the Democratic party.
    </p>
    <p>
      II. The records of the War Department show that 2,688,523 men were called
      into the national service from the beginning to the end of the war. Deduct
      from this number 75,000, and you have the additional number called into
      service because of the secret machinations and villa-nies heretofore
      spoken of., viz, 2,613,523, every man of whom is chargeable, fairly
      chargeable, unquestionably chargeable to the Democratic party.
    </p>
    <p>
      III. At the close of the fiscal year (June 30th) for 1861, the Treasurer
      reported the debt of the United States to be $90,867,828. On the 31st of
      March, 1865, the Treasurer reported the public debt of the United States
      to be $2,423,437,001, showing an increase during the war of
      $2,332,567,173. This increase of debt of the general government by no
      means represents the sum-total cost of the war; for, meanwhile, the people
      had been paying immensely increased taxes every year, and beside this
      every State, every county, every large city, and almost every township of
      the North had been issuing bonds with which to pay bounties and other war
      expenses, so that in 1865 the amount of bounties paid by States and local
      authorities, so far as returned to the general government, amounted to
      $285,941,036. Add this to the government debt and you have the sum of
      $2,709,378,037. It is difficult, if not impossible, for any mind to really
      comprehend so large a sum, and the only way to appreciate it is to divide
      it among families, or individualize it. In 1860 the United States census
      returns show for the eighteen Northern States 18,855,831. In 1870 the
      returns show for the same States 24,035,359. There being no census returns
      for 1865 (as the United States census is only taken at the close of each
      ten years), the only way to approximate the population then is to divide
      the increase between 1860 and 1870. This indicates a population in these
      eighteen States for 1865 to have been about 21,445,595. Now the average
      estimate for each family is five. This would give us 4,289,119 families as
      existing in these States at that time. Next, divide the number of families
      into the number of dollars of public debt, and you show that upon each
      family was saddled, at the close of the war, a debt of $631.68. Or, to
      individualize it, divide this sum by five, and you have the sum of $126.33
      as the average debt then owing by every mart, woman, and child then
      residing in the eighteen Northern States. Thus, it mattered not how poor a
      man was, or how many children he had, a ticket of indebtedness for the sum
      of $126.33 was plastered on the forehead of each. "Oh, well," some one may
      say, "that was easy enough for rich men to pay, and of course the poor
      never paid it, nor never will, since many of the very poor never handle as
      much money as that in all their lives. Why, to a man with ten children
      (and the poor, you know, generally have the most) that would have made a
      debt of $1515.96, which of course he could never pay, in addition to
      supporting his family." Ah! but, my friend, there is just where you are
      most mistaken; for it is just that class of men, together with farmers,
      who do pay much the larger proportion of public debts. True, they never
      pay it, nor would try to pay it, in dollars and cents to the tax-gatherer;
      but they pay it in the increased price they pay the merchant for the tea
      and coffee they drink, for the muslins and woollens, and hats and shoes
      they wear; they pay it in increased rents and decreased wages; and the
      farmer pays it not only in every article that he purchases, but in
      increased taxes and in decreased receipts for what he raises to sell. And
      what these fail to pay, the rich have to pay in increased taxes for State,
      county, township, or municipal purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let us apply these facts to the solving of the problem (third)&mdash;How
      much additional did it cost?
    </p>
    <p>
      This we can only do approximately by stating the problem thus: If to bring
      into the field 2,688,523 men for forty-seven months cost $2,709,378,037,
      how much would it have cost to bring in 75,000 for three months? Deduct
      this sum, amounting to $4,824,369 from the whole cost, and we have
      remaining the sum of $2,704,553,668 as the additional cost of the war
      because of the secret machinations and most desperate villanies described
      in the previous chapters of this book&mdash;every dollar of which, every
      penny of which, is justly chargeable to the Democratic party as a party.
      Or, to make the matter still plainer, more than three-fourths of all the
      taxes which the poor man, or farmer, or rich man has heretofore paid, or
      will hereafter pay, whether upon what he eats and drinks and wears, or
      upon cash paid tax-collector, is directly chargeable to the Democratic
      party.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV. How many additional lives were sacrificed? This, like the last
      question, can only be answered approximately, and by the same process of
      reasoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reports made to the War Department, during the war, show the total
      loss to have been 280,420 men&mdash;the very sight of which figures makes
      the heart sink in agony and sicken over the thought, and yet there is no
      escaping their terrible reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get at the additional sacrifice, the proposition may be stated thus: If
      in a war lasting forty-seven months, with 2,688,523 men in service (of
      whom 1,500,000 it is estimated were in battles), the sacrifice of life
      amounted to 280,420 men, what would have been the sacrifice had the war
      lasted only three months, with 75,000 men in service? The answer to this
      problem is 499 lives. Now take this number from the former, and you have
      as the additional number 279,921 lives&mdash;the loss of which is as
      fairly attributable to the Democratic party as though it had by sentence
      condemned, and by its own power had executed, every one of these men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remains of thousands and tens of thousands who died in the service
      never were gathered, but to-day lie in Southern swamps, scattered over
      Southern cotton-fields, or at the bottom of the deep, blue sea, "unknown,
      unhonored, and unwept;" but the remains of other thousands and tens of
      thousands have been gathered, and now lie in National cemeteries at
      Arlington Heights, at Gettysburg, at Antietam, at Beverly, and at many
      other places throughout the length and breadth of our land. The above
      calculations show&mdash;and figures never lie when correctly placed&mdash;that
      if upon ninety-five out of every one hundred headstones erected to the
      memory of these departed heroes in the National and private cemeteries of
      our country were written the words, <i>Died by the hands of the Democratic
      party</i>, the record would be as true as anything now written upon those
      headstones.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are fully aware of the terrible character of this indictment. We know
      already how many thousands will hold up their hands in holy horror and
      exclaim, Oh, this cannot be so! These are not the words of a historian,
      but of a politician, who allows his prejudices to get the better of his
      reason! But hold, my friend, hold, and think twice before you condemn
      once. Are they not words of truth and soberness? Examine each proposition
      just as carefully as you would examine one of Euclid's problems (for this
      is just what we have tried to do), and see if it is possible to reach any
      other conclusion. Republican though we certainly are, yet, in examining
      these questions as a historian, we have tried to divest our mind of every
      particle of political prejudice, and though the results of our researches
      and calculations are as astounding, as terrible, as sickening-of-heart to
      us as they can possibly be to any one of our readers, yet the figures
      would show no other, and we have had to accept them as veritable.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet the secret is only half out&mdash;the story, as yet, but half
      told. The losses of time, of money, and of lives heretofore spoken of
      relate only to the North&mdash;the Southern side of the story remains yet
      to be told; for in this volume we are writing no less for the information
      of Southern than of Northern men, nor would we in this record do any less
      justice to the South than to the North.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jefferson Davis, however wild and mistaken politically, was never other
      than a high-minded, chivalrous gentleman. He was just as honest in his
      advocacy of slavery as Paul was in his advocacy of Phariseeism; and when
      Davis went forth to catch, imprison, and, if need be, to slay the enemies
      of slavery, he did it as conscientiously as Paul did, or meant to do, his
      work, in going to Damascus with the commission of a high-priest in his
      pocket Not only so, but President Davis was a man of deep knowledge, a
      thorough statistician, a cool calculator, and one who never took a step
      without first carefully counting the cost. He was the farthest possible
      remove from a reckless man. When a young man in the United States army and
      with the troops in Mexico, he never struck a blow, or made the least move,
      without first considering all the chances. In this respect he was almost
      as careful and as prudent as his renowned father-in-law, General Zachary
      Taylor. As a United States Senator he was remarkable for his caution and
      foresight, and though he sometimes took part in sharp debate, his general
      political tactics were conservative, watch for chances, investigate
      thoroughly, and then strike with effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, we have it only second-handed from President Davis's own lips that he
      would never have thought of a war with the North&mdash;never would have
      recommended such a war&mdash;never would have engaged in such a war&mdash;"<i>but
      for encouragement given him, and actual pledges made him, by leading
      Democrats of the Northern States</i>." He had once been Secretary of War;
      he had been a United States Senator for several years preceding the
      rebellion; he thoroughly understood the resources, not only of the general
      government, but of each individual State, and would, as he said, have
      thought it perfect madness for the South to have attempted a separate
      confederation, "<i>but for the pledges of assistance made him and others
      by leading Democrats of the Northern States</i>." Of this, as an
      historical fact, there is no more doubt than that there was a war. Outside
      of President Davis's own word, the facts heretofore related in this
      volume, and a thousand others which might be adduced, are confirmatory of
      these statements. .
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, the men whom President Davis had about him as a Cabinet and as
      outside advisers were generally men of marked intelligence and large
      experience, one of whom (John Tyler) had been President of the United
      States; some had been United States Senators; others, Congressmen; others
      had all their lives been connected with the army or navy; and scarcely one
      of all but what thoroughly understood the strength and resources, not only
      of the general government, but of each State, North and South. Is it to be
      presumed that a single one of these men would have ever thought of
      rebellion, or said one word to encourage it, <i>but for the assurances
      they had from leading Northern Democrats that the party, as a party, would
      sustain them in such a movement?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      If these facts be admitted, and this inference be conceded, does it not
      follow as an inevitable conclusion that the <i>Democratic party, as a
      party</i>, is responsible before God, and should be held responsible
      before all men, for the <i>time wasted, the money squandered, and the
      lives sacrificed</i> by the South in their attempt to establish a separate
      confederacy?
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot give the exact figures, for the archives of the Confederate
      government were mostly destroyed when the rebels fled and the Union army
      took possession of Richmond; but think, reader, think how many weary days,
      and weeks, and months, and years of untold suffering that was caused by
      that mad and murderous attempt; think of the houses burned, homes
      desolated, plantations ruined, by the frenzy and fury of reckless
      demagogues; think of the thousands of affluent families made homeless and
      penniless by this mad attempt, and of the thousands upon thousands who
      were once comfortable now turned out as beggars to die, through the
      efforts of a band of conspirators; think of the millions upon millions of
      hard-earned dollars squandered, worse than squandered, by this mad
      attempt; think of the thousands upon thousands of wives made widows,
      children made fatherless, parents made childless, by this foul treason;
      and then think&mdash;for if you are honest with your own conscience, and
      can rid yourself of political prejudice, you must think it&mdash;that all
      this waste of time, all this squandering of money, all this sacrifice of
      lives, all this suffering of wives, of children, of parents, <i>is
      unquestionably chargeable</i> to the <i>Democratic party;</i> and, with
      this last thought, ask yourself the question, What should be thought of&mdash;what
      should be the fate of&mdash;a party guilty of such unparalleled
      wickedness?
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, to this last question there could be but one answer, and yet
      the party feebly lives! Why it lives&mdash;for what purpose it lives&mdash;would
      be the next question which would naturally arise with every searcher after
      truth. To these inquiries we will try to give an answer, not an opinion
      merely, but an answer founded upon accredited history, as have been all
      the answers heretofore given.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is well known to every student of history that, as far back as 1817,
      the leading sovereigns and princes of Europe, in their solemn conclaves
      and secret treaties with each other, formed the determination to subvert
      the liberties of the United States. Much of what was said and done at that
      time leaked out, and was duly communicated by our ministers and consuls
      abroad to the general government; but so conscious was our government of
      its own strength in the hearts of the people, that all such threats passed
      them by like the idle wind. When, however, the Duke of Richmond died in
      Montreal in 1819&mdash;a man whom everybody knew to be a sagacious and
      wise statesman, and whose many high employments had made him intimate with
      all the sovereigns and politics of Europe, and whose deep personal
      interests at stake gave to his opinions immense weight&mdash;and when he
      declared, a short time before his death, that "The surplus population of
      Europe, when not wanted for the armies and navies of their own land, would
      be permitted to flock here, and would be entitled to vote; and, mingling
      in the elections without a knowledge or a love of the laws, or even the
      language, of the country, will be tools for demagogues, and create a
      disturbing influence, which the government cannot withstand;" and when to
      this he added, "I have conversed with many of the princes and sovereigns
      of Europe, particularly with George III. and Louis XVIII., and they have
      unanimously expressed these opinions relative to the government of the
      United States, and their determination to subvert it"&mdash;when, we say,
      these were published and became generally known shortly after his death,
      they did for a little while create some excitement, and both government
      officials and the people had something to say about these statements; but
      such was the confidence felt in our own strength, that the words of the
      Duke were soon forgotten, and were laid away with the "mouldering past."
    </p>
    <p>
      Only three years thereafter (in A. d. 1822) the great powers of Europe
      held a congress at Vienna, and among the conclusions then and there
      reached, and which formed a part of their treaty stipulations, the two
      following cannot but strike Americans with great force:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Article I. The high contracting powers being convinced that the system of
      representative governments is equally as incompatible with monarchical
      principles, as the maxim of the sovereignty of the people with the divine
      right of kings, engage mutually, in the most solemn manner, to use all
      their efforts to put an end to the system of representative governments in
      Europe, and to prevent its being introduced into those countries where it
      is not known.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Article II. As it cannot be doubted that the liberty of the press is the
      most powerful means used by the pretended supporters of the rights of
      nations to the detriment of those princes, the high contracting powers
      promise reciprocally to adopt all proper means to suppress it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The representatives of this government in Europe got hold of these
      articles soon after, and duly communicated them to the State Department at
      Washington; and the newspapers of this country also got hold of them, and
      for awhile had considerable to say about them; but erelong the excitement
      of both government and people died out, and things went on in their usual
      way. How many times since then the powers of Europe have met in secret
      conclave and reaffirmed what they then said, and adopted secret measures
      whereby to carry out these resolves, is not generally known, for the
      reason that the excitement following their first promulgation gave them
      warning that whatever they said or did in that direction thereafter had
      better be with closed doors, and under the most sacred pledges of profound
      secrecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The congress at Vienna was held soon after they had lodged the First
      Napoleon safely at St. Helena, and when all the world seemed to be
      applauding them for the act, and hence their outspoken boldness in
      denouncing representative forms of government and the liberty of the
      press. Indeed, in view of what they had all just witnessed, and some of
      them severely felt, it was not at all unnatural that they should have
      adopted the two articles quoted; and that they should have ever since felt
      that there was an irrepressible conflict between the "divine right of
      kings" and representative forms of government&mdash;between the absolute
      rule of kings and the liberty of the press, and that one or the other must
      eventually supersede the other. Hence, with them it became a question of
      self preservation&mdash;the very first law of nature&mdash;and under such
      circumstances it was not at all wonderful that they resolved just as they
      did.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had recently witnessed the final act of a French drama and tragedy
      combined&mdash;the French Revolution, and the career of Napoleon as a
      consequence thereof&mdash;which they regarded as results of a
      representative form of government and of the liberty of the press; but
      which were results rather of irresponsible personal government and license
      of the press. They had seen or read of the assembling of a French
      parliament that had refused to register the royal edicts; they had
      witnessed or read of the disputes between the king and parliament, and the
      death soon after of Louis XV.; from thence they had observed the spread of
      liberal opinions and the accession of Louis XVI. to the throne of France;
      next, they had seen or read of the calling together of the States-General,
      and how they, soon after assembling, had assumed the name of the "National
      Assembly;" they knew of the dismissal of Neckar; the destruction of the
      Bastile; the abolishment of the privileges of the nobles and clergy, and
      of the first insult offered to the king and royal family; of Robespierre's
      government and the dreadful disorders accompanying it; of Lafayette's
      resignation; of the trial and execution of Louis XVI. and of his queen,
      Marie Antoinette, and of the Duke of Orleans; of the Convention's
      abjuration of the Catholic religion and substitution of reason in its
      place; of the abolition of the Sabbath; of the tens of thousands beheaded,
      or otherwise slaughtered, in Paris; of how Napoleon Bonaparte had finally
      appeared upon the scene, and for a while seemed to still the troubled
      waters; but how he erelong not only usurped the crown, but commenced war
      upon almost every nation of Europe; how in a hundred battles fought by
      him, at Austerlitz and elsewhere, he had been successful in almost every
      one; how he had finally invaded Russia and thus defeated himself; how he
      was afterwards made to resign and sent in banishment to Elba; how he had
      again reappeared in France and resumed power; how all the allied powers of
      Europe then determined upon his destruction; how he was defeated at the
      battle of Waterloo; how he afterwards surrendered himself into the hands
      of the English; and how, on the 17th of October, 1815, he was landed at
      St. Helena a prisoner of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this they knew, and all this they set down as the natural results of a
      representative form of government and the liberty of the press, and hence
      it was that the first two articles of the treaty, from which we have
      heretofore quoted, were specially aimed against them; and a solemn pledge
      made, each to the other, that they must be destroyed. Of course, no
      mention was made in that treaty of the United States; for to have done so
      would have been virtually a declaration of war; but as it was then
      generally believed among the sovereigns and princes of Europe that the
      French Revolution of 1789 was a natural outgrowth from the American
      Revolution of 1776, and that Lafayette was at the bottom of it all&mdash;having
      imbibed the ideas from George Washington, John Adams, John Hancock, and
      other revolutionists of America,&mdash;the inference is plain and
      unmistakable that those two articles were aimed at the United States, and
      that the word "Europe"&mdash;where it reads they "engage mutually, in the
      most solemn manner, to use all their efforts to put an end to the system
      of representative governments in Europe"&mdash;was only meant as a
      blinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, it may next be asked, allowing all this to be so, have they been
      doing anything since that time whereby to carry out any such intention?
    </p>
    <p>
      To this inquiry, we answer yes, and will now proceed to show, briefly but
      unmistakably, how they have been carrying out such intentions; and this,
      too, comes legitimately under the head of "Secrets of the Late Rebellion,
      now Revealed for the First Time," since no one, to our knowledge, has ever
      heretofore shown the close relationship and unity of purpose between these
      same European governments and the Democratic party of the United States;
      and how, in the late rebellion (as in many instances before that time),
      they joined hands to destroy this government, and to break down the
      liberty of the press.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first two political parties in the United States were known as <i>Federal</i>
      and <i>Republican</i>. In 1800, John Adams was the candidate of the
      Federalists for a second presidential term, and Thomas Jefferson the
      candidate of the Republicans. Jefferson was elected, and took his seat as
      President of the United States on the 4th of March, 1801. After a time,
      these two names gave way to Whig and Democratic. These continued until the
      name Republican took the place of Whig, in 1856-60. In its earlier days
      the Democratic party, as a party, was as pure and patriotic as any party
      that ever existed in this or any other country; but when the question of
      "Protection to Home Industry" (of which Henry Clay was the leading
      champion in his time) became a prime question in American politics; and
      when, because that this question involved the interests of European
      capitalists and manufacturers, Augustus Belmont, of New York city (a
      European by birth, a Jew, and the agent in this country of the
      Rothschilds', the great Jew banking-house of Europe, to whom almost every
      sovereign in Europe was indebted for loans), became the Chairman of the
      National Democratic Executive Committee&mdash;from that moment the
      Democratic party, as a party, became as completely in the interests of
      European sovereigns, capitalists, and manufacturers, as though every
      member of the party, as well as its head and front, had been born a
      European. We are not, of course, attempting to write a history of parties.
      To do so would require a volume of itself, and a large one at that. We
      have only made this running sketch that those not familiar with general
      history may readily see and understand the unmistakable historical
      relationship which exists, and which has existed for some forty years
      past, between the Democratic party, as a party, and European governments,
      European capitalists, and European manufacturers.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this fact in mind, it is easy to understand why ninety out of every
      one hundred European emigrants who come to this country attach themselves
      to the Democratic party; easy to understand why the entire influence of
      the Roman Catholic Church (which is the church of nine-tenths of the
      sovereigns of Europe) should be thrown in favor of the Democratic party;
      easy to understand why more than ninety-five out of every one hundred Jews
      who come to this country from Europe attach themselves to the Democratic
      party; and easy to understand why, in the late rebellion, the Democratic
      party, as a party, cooperated with English lords, with English
      capitalists, and with English manufacturers (as shown in previous chapters
      of this volume), in trying to break down this government, and establish a
      slaveocracy in its stead&mdash;the leaders (not the masses) well knowing
      that this would soon give way to a yet more concentrated form of
      government in order to hold their slaves in subjection&mdash;neither a
      landed and family aristocracy, like that of England, or an absolute
      monarchy, like that of Austria, in either of which cases a representative
      or republican form of government and the liberty of the press would have
      been effectually and forever suppressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer, then, to the two questions, Why it lives? For what purpose it
      lives? are, to the first, Because of the additions made to the party from
      year to year from foreign emigration; and to the second the answer is, For
      the purpose of playing into the hands of European sovereigns, European
      capitalists, and European manufacturers, with a view to set aside a
      representative form of government, and destroy the liberty of the press in
      this country; and these answers we give, it will be observed, not from a
      political, but from a historical, stand-point&mdash;facts which cannot be
      controverted, and deductions from those facts as natural and as undeniable
      as that we know arsenic to be a poison, because it invariably kills when
      taken in certain doses. And that the Democratic party, as a party, is as
      deadly a poison as arsenic we know to be true, because it has killed its
      thousands and tens of thousands, than which we want no other or better
      proof than is furnished by the preceding chapters of this volume.

    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HREE more
      questions, please, and then I will not trouble you more. What you have
      already said seems to be true, and yet so new and so strange are these
      revelations to my ears&mdash;stranger than any fiction I ever read in the
      works of Sir Walter Scott or others&mdash;that had you not substantiated
      each proposition with arguments drawn from antecedent probability, from
      sign, and from example, I could scarcely have believed them. But three
      queries yet remain in my mind. Allowing all that you have said to be
      veritable history, how comes it that the South has not denounced the
      Democratic party for its perfidy in making promises which it never
      fulfilled? How comes it that, with such a weight of sin upon it, the party
      can still be kept alive? And, from all your study of history, what
      deductions do you draw as to the final decline and fall&mdash;if such a
      thing is to be&mdash;of this Republic?
    </p>
    <p>
      Your questions are plain, frank, yet pointed, and I will endeavor to
      answer each in as plain and frank a manner. First, as to the truth of what
      we have already said, if the statements and propositions related to any
      other than a political subject, there would be no more doubt of their
      truthfulness than of any statement or proposition made by Gibbon,
      Macaulay, Bancroft, or any other historian. But upon the two subjects of
      politics and religion, men are generally so set in their opinion that
      blindness in the one and bigotry in the other seems to be as natural to
      the human mind "as for grass to be green, or skies to be blue, on bright
      clear days in June." Nor are such statements ever allowed to go
      unchallenged, however true they may be, unless the parties have been so
      long dead and buried that no sympathy remains. What Macaulay says of
      political parties and of church influences in his <i>History of England,</i>
      is just as true as any other part of his admirable work, and yet the work
      had scarcely made its appearance before the most violent epithets were
      hurled at him because of these. Had Gibbon written his Decline and Fall of
      the Roman Empire ten or even five centuries earlier, it would have
      received most bitter denunciation from all who yet sympathized with the
      wrongs which Gibbon pointed out, and even so late as the eighteenth
      century, when his work was first published, it did not escape censure.
      While Bancroft only wrote of the long, long ago, in his capital History of
      the United States, nobody questioned his statements or deductions; but as
      he approached nearer to the present, and had of necessity to say something
      of the acts and influence of political parties and of churches, he awoke
      the sleeping demons&mdash;blindness and bigotry&mdash;and from thenceforth
      there was more or less growl whenever a new volume appeared. I revive and
      mention these facts now, only to show you, my friend, that I am not at all
      surprised at your inquiries; nor shall I be surprised if the last six
      chapters of this volume, and, because of these, the whole book, are most
      violently and bitterly denounced by the entire Democratic press of this
      country, and by every religious and political journal in this country and
      Europe whose special province it is to uphold foreign religious and
      political influence. With these as introductory remarks, I will now
      proceed to answer your inquiries.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. How comes it that the South has not denounced the Democratic party for
      its perfidy in making promises which it never fulfilled?
    </p>
    <p>
      We have no sympathy now, and never had, with rebellion, as such; and,
      while it continued, helped to fight it as best we could; but we had then,
      and have now, a very deep sympathy with those who were blindly led to
      their own destruction by wicked, designing men. To no people in all of
      history are the words of our blessed Saviour more applicable than to the
      people of the South, when he said, "Woe unto the world because of
      offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by
      whom the offence cometh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      We have heretofore spoken of Jefferson Davis, his Cabinet, and of others
      with whom he advised, as high-minded, honorable gentlemen. This character
      they had before the war, maintained it during the war, and such as
      survived continued to maintain it after the war. After the war, Mr. Davis
      had but little to say of the events of the past. He preferred not to talk
      of them at all, as he often said to those who broached the subject, and
      never would talk of them except to his most confidential friends. He
      desired to live a quiet, peaceful, retired, Christian life, in the bosom
      of his little family (and no man ever had a truer or more faithful
      helpmeet than Mrs. Davis proved to be to her husband), nor would he allow
      himself to talk of politics at all, as before stated, except to a very
      few. From one of these few we have it, as from Mr. Davis's own lips, that
      no one felt, nor could feel, more keenly than he did, the perfidy, the
      meanness, the baseness which had been practised upon the South by certain
      leading Democratic politicians of the North; and yet he could not but
      recollect that others, as they had opportunity, had aided him and their
      cause to the full extent of their ability, and had the will to aid them a
      thousand times more, if they could have done so with safety to themselves,
      personally and pecuniarily. This last recollection took the keen edge off
      the first, and left a sort of dulcamara&mdash;a bitter-sweet&mdash;to rest
      upon his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, besides this, only a choice of evils was left to him and his
      followers. Their own party of Secession having been destroyed, only the
      Democratic and Republican parties remained. To side with or go into the
      Republican party was out of the question. Such as did, would be charged
      with, or suspected of, treachery by both sides. To denounce and yet expect
      to get into, or cooperate with, the Democratic party, was out of the
      question. No one can regard as a friend one that curses him. So, you see,
      they were walled in, as it were, on every side, and, as a choice of evils,
      thought it best to go into the Democratic party&mdash;to which most of
      them had belonged all their lives, previous to the rebellion&mdash;to hold
      their peace, and to "wait for the good time coming which the voice of
      certain siren leaders still whispered into their ears. We say this not in
      a poetic, but in a historic sense; for we know it to be true that, after
      the close of the rebellion, prominent leaders of the Democratic party
      North said to prominent gentlemen of the South that so soon as they could
      get the general government once again into their own hands, all Southern
      claims upon the government, because of the war, should be adjusted, the
      same as Northern claims had been; all bonds issued by the Confederate
      government during the war should be placed upon precisely the same footing
      as the bonds issued by the United States government during the same
      period; and that slavery should be restored as it was before the war, or
      those who had owned slaves, or their legal representatives, should be paid
      full value for every slave they had lost. When it was said to them that to
      do all this would require several alterations in the United States
      Constitution as it now stands, their ready reply was, "Only put the
      government into our hands, and we'll find means to amend the Constitution
      just as readily as to make laws, for all needed purposes. Your wrongs and
      ours will find a way, or make one!" With such assurances, made over and
      over again in the most solemn manner, how could a Southern man find it in
      his heart to denounce the Democratic party, notwithstanding all the wrongs
      he had suffered from it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Some seventeen years have now passed since the close of that war. As a
      matter of history it is well known that over ninety-five per cent, of
      those who had taken an active part in the Confederate cause went into the
      Democratic party, and since that time have steadily cooperated with that
      party. A few, a very few, could not, as they said, forgive the treachery
      and the wrongs of the Democratic party towards the South, and these went
      into the Republican party&mdash;some honestly, no doubt; others, only
      because they thought it would "pay best."
    </p>
    <p>
      Another answer to your query would be, that in not denouncing, but by
      going into, the Democratic party a very large proportion of Southern men
      were only returning to their first love. In the days of Whiggery several
      of the Southern States gave Whig majorities; but when that party died,
      because of its coquetting with slavery, and the Republican party took its
      place, the leading principle of which new party was opposition to slavery,
      first, as to its extension, and then as to its continuance, nearly the
      whole vote of the South became Democratic. This was very plainly shown in
      the vote cast for Franklin Pierce and Winfield Scott (the last Whig
      candidate), in 1852, when the former received two hundred and fifty-four
      electoral votes and the latter only forty-two. Indeed, it was this fact,
      and the great preponderance of Democratic votes at that election, that
      gave to the Secessionists of the South, and their sympathizers, aiders,
      and abettors of the North, the encouragement which caused them to
      inaugurate a rebellion in 1860. It was this, together with the fact that
      out of the thirty-two preceding years&mdash;from the election of Jackson
      in 1828 to that of Lincoln in 1860&mdash;the Democrats had held the power
      twenty-four years and the Whigs only eight. They had grown to look upon
      the Democratic power as invincible, and their European coadjutors had been
      made to believe that the time had finally come when the hated
      representative form of the United States government could be changed into
      a slaveocracy, then into an aristocracy, and then into a kingly form of
      government; while a censorship could be placed upon the press so
      effectual, that from thenceforth it could never do European sovereignties
      or the Roman Catholic Church any harm. Those who only saw the outside of
      the late rebellion supposed that it had its incipiency in 1860, whereas
      those who knew of its inside workings (as we all know now), knew that
      preparations had been going on for eight years previous, and that both
      Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan, from 1852 to 1860, had only been used
      as tools or instruments by which to forward these preparations. The result
      of the Presidential vote in 1856 only made those in the secret of the
      secession movement (both in this country and in Europe) the more
      determined to strike the blow in 1860; for they saw by that vote that,
      while their candidate, Buchanan, was elected by a majority of fifty-two
      electoral votes (Buchanan one hundred and seventy-four, Fremont et al. one
      hundred and twenty-two), yet the popular vote stood Buchanan 1,838,169,
      Fremont et al. 2,215,498, being really against their candidate, on the
      popular vote, to the extent of 377,329 votes. This strange result was
      owing to the fact that, while all the Southern States voted for their
      candidate, and several Northern States as well, they were all by small
      majorities; whereas such of the Northern States as voted for Fremont and
      others did so by large majorities. Had they delayed the strike another
      four years, it would have been forever too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      So soon as the secret commenced to ooze out among the masses, it caused no
      little commotion in the Democratic party itself, and when they came to
      name presidential candidates in 1860, while those in the secret boldly put
      forward John C. Breckenridge (who afterwards became a rebel general in
      their army), the more timid and doubting named Stephen A. Douglas, while
      those who were yet more frightened at the prospect of coming events named
      Bell of Tennessee. The Republicans named Abraham Lincoln. The result
      showed one hundred and eighty electoral votes for Lincoln and one hundred
      and twenty-three for all the others (again the South voting solid against
      the Republican nominee), while the popular vote showed 1,866,352 for
      Lincoln, and 2,810,501 for all the others. The South by that time became
      so thoroughly identified with the Democratic party, and the Democratic
      party with the South, that, like man and wife, their interests were
      thenceforth inseparable, while the groomsman and bridesmaid (fitly
      represented by European sovereignty and the Roman Catholic Church) stood
      at their sides, or close behind, tapping them on the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      And just here let us say, lest we may be misunderstood, that when we speak
      of the Catholic Church it is not by way of disparagement, so far as their
      religion is concerned, but only and purely as one of the instruments by
      which European sovereigns hope to work the downfall of this nation, or
      rather of the representative form of its government and the liberty of its
      press. Against the religious faith and the religious zeal of the Catholics
      we have not a word to say, though ourself a Protestant. History, as well
      as our own eyes and ears while travelling in Europe, has proven to us that
      with every ounce of corruption to be found in that Church there is a full
      pound of virtue, and, better than this, so far as we know, cannot be said
      of any other church organization. We cannot forget, nor overlook the
      facts, that while Tetzel was peddling indulgences and Luther was
      thundering against them, thousands of Sisters of Charity (God bless them!)
      were waiting upon the sick and dying in Paris and elsewhere, and doing
      what they could to make life tolerable and death endurable to thousands
      and tens of thousands; that while scores were being tortured and burned by
      the Spanish inquisition, thousands of faithful Catholic missionaries, in
      all parts of the world, were enlightening their fellow-men, easing their
      burdens of life, and pointing them to a hope beyond the grave. Nor can we
      overlook the fact that other religious bodies have been just as bigoted
      and just as intolerant as the Catholics, whenever they have had the power
      and opportunity; that John Calvin and his followers burned Servetus, at
      Geneva, with just as little compunction of conscience as the Catholics
      burned Huss at Constance; that Luther and his coadjutors granted to
      Philip, the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, a dispensation for polygamy, rather
      than lose his support, while Clement VII., Pope of Rome, refused a like
      dispensation to Henry VIII., King of England; that this same Henry, who
      was acknowledged at the time as the head of the Church of England,
      divorced two wives and beheaded two others; and that even here, in our own
      New England, when the Puritans had absolute power, they ordered delicate
      Quaker women tied to a cart-tail and whipped upon the bare back, and
      others hung, for no other reason than that they chose to worship God in a
      different way from themselves. A somewhat careful study of the rise and
      progress of all religions, and of all religious sects, convinces us that
      bigotry, intolerance, and persecution are alike common to all whenever
      they hold absolute power, and that in this respect the Catholics are no
      worse than others.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, while saying all this, no less in justice to ourself than to
      them, we must not overlook the fact that Catholicism is the religion of a
      large majority of the sovereigns and princes of Europe; that absolutism
      (and consequent opposition to anything like a representative form of
      government, or the liberty of the press) is one of its cardinal principles
      of faith and practice; that, being so largely supported by European
      sovereigns, it would naturally be disposed to aid them in any way within
      its power; and that to aid them in overthrowing our representative form of
      government, and our boasted liberty of the press, would be no violation of
      their own cherished principles, but in exact accordance therewith. Hence
      in all our calculations as to influence and power, without having the
      least prejudice against the religion of the Catholics, we must invariably
      put them down as in favor of absolutism, and as only using, in this
      country, the name democracy (which means the reverse of absolutism) as a
      cloak to their real sentiments. Of course in this we only refer to the
      bishops, priests, and few educated laymen of the Catholic Church; for, as
      to the great mass of its adherents, they merely follow the dictum of
      others, without knowing or caring about the meaning of names, and would
      vote under any name, or for anybody, if only told to do so by their church
      officials.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a matter of public notoriety&mdash;indeed of public record&mdash;that,
      under the name of "Societies for the Propagation of the Faith," the
      sovereigns of Europe, and their more wealthy subjects, have sent, and are
      every year sending, large sums of money to this country. A single one of
      these societies at Lyons, France (as published in their own reports at the
      time), sent in this way $65,438 in 1839; $163,000 in 1840; $177,000 in
      1842; $207,218 in 1843, while correspondingly large sums were doubtless
      sent from Spain, Austria, and other European countries during the same
      years; and from that time until the present every year. A portion of this
      was and is undoubtedly contributed from the purest of religious motives;
      but by far the larger portion, only with the view to subvert our
      representative form of government and the liberty of the press. 'All these
      are matters of history, and as such come legitimately within the province
      of any historian, and of any reader, who, aside from religious or
      political prejudices, would carefully weigh facts with a view to arrive at
      undoubted conclusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus, my friend (the reader), have we, by reciting historic facts, and
      through the processes of deduction and induction, shown you very plainly
      "How it comes that the South has not denounced the Democratic party for
      its perfidy in making promises which it never fulfilled;" and thus, my
      friend, I have, I think, fully and fairly answered your first inquiry.

      CHAPTER XIX. &mdash; II.&mdash;HOW COMES IT THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY,
      WITH SUCH A
    </h2>
    <h3>
      WEIGHT OF SIN UPON IT, CAN STILL BE KEPT ALIVE?
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>O answer this
      question, we would first direct your attention to the United States census
      returns for the years 1850,'60,'70, and 80. We only go back four decades,
      for from these we can draw correct conclusions just as well as if we
      commenced at an earlier date. These returns show that for the ten years
      preceding 1850 there arrived in this country from Europe 1,713,251
      persons; for the ten preceding 1860, 2,598,214; for the ten preceding
      1870, 2,491,209; and for the ten preceding 1880, 2,742,137. Of those that
      came from Catholic countries, 95 out of every 100 went into the Democratic
      party. Of those that came from Germany and other Protestant countries,
      probably about one-half went into the Democratic party; for even though
      they came from nominally Protestant countries, fully one-half of the
      emigrants from those countries are Catholics. Of those who are Protestants
      in Europe, but few join the Democratic party after reaching this country.
      Estimating that one out of every five of these emigrants becomes a voter,
      and that 85 out of every 100 of these voters joined the Democratic party,
      we should have as added to that party from naturalization alone, for the
      ten years preceding 1850, 290,753 votes; for the ten preceding 1860,
      431,696 votes; for the ten preceding 1870, 424,505 votes; and for the ten
      preceding 1880, 466,164 votes. Meanwhile, while these immense additions
      are being made from year to year to the Democratic party from
      naturalization, it loses large numbers every year from increased
      civilization. The Whig party was, and the Republican party is, the party
      of enlightenment; and as foreigners, and especially their children, become
      more enlightened as to the advantages of a republican or representative
      form of government&mdash;more and more enlightened as to the advantages of
      a free press&mdash;they leave that party and go into the Republican; or,
      what is more frequent, their children, having been educated in our free
      schools, learn to love freedom of thought as well as of action, and, on
      becoming of age, join the Republican party, and some of them join
      Protestant churches. But for this retroactive process, which is constantly
      going on, this country long ago would have been completely under foreign
      influence, and we never should have been permitted to have celebrated the
      one hundredth anniversary of American independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let us take a retrospective view and see what has been the practical
      outcome of these two antagonistic principles. In 1852 the number of
      Democratic votes cast for President was 1,601,474; number of Whig votes,
      1,542,403; total, 3,143,877; population of the United States in 1850,
      23,191,876. In 1860, number of Republican votes, 1,866,352; Democratic and
      all others, 2,810,501; total, 4,676,853; population that year, 31,443,321.
      In 1872, number of Republican votes, 3,597,070; Democratic, 2,834,078;
      total, 6,431,148; population for 1870, 38,558,371. In 1880, number of
      Republican votes, 4,450,921; Democratic, 4,447,888; total, 8,898,809;
      population for 1880, 50,155,783.
    </p>
    <p>
      The immigration for the last few years has been exceedingly large,
      reaching the enormous figures of 457,257 for 1880, and 669,431 for 1881.
      Among these were 2,600 Jews from Russia, of whom it is announced there are
      10,000 more to come soon, and for whom contract has already been made with
      the Hamburg line of steamers. Of these it is safe to calculate that 95 out
      of every 100 voters will go into the Democratic party.
    </p>
    <p>
      As showing the effect of the retroactive process heretofore spoken of,
      whereby enlightenment turns Catholics into Protestants and Democrats into
      Republicans, it may be stated (as census returns show) that while in 1801
      there were in the two Protestant countries of Great Britain and the United
      States about 6,000,000 Roman Catholics to about 15,000,000 Protestants, or
      about one to two and a-half, in 1880 there were about 12,000,000 Catholics
      to about 74,000,000 Protestants, or about one to six. In using the word
      enlightenment in connection with the words Republican and Protestant, we
      would by no means have it inferred that all Democrats and all Catholics
      are ignorant. In both are to be found men of the highest intelligence and
      of the most exalted character; but these form the exception rather than
      the rule&mdash;the leading few, who have their own purposes to subserve,
      rather than the following many, with whom party is madness only for the
      benefit of the few.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, my friend (the reader), you can begin to see, can you not, why it is
      that the Democratic party, notwithstanding all its sins, has still been
      kept alive? But yet there is one more item to be added to account for its
      continued existence: namely, that it is not only supplied with recruits
      from Europe, but with money as well. We have heretofore shown from
      official sources how many hundreds of thousands of dollars have been, and
      are constantly being sent from Europe to this country to "propagate" the
      Catholic faith&mdash;which is, indeed, but another name and another way of
      propagating the Democratic party&mdash;and but for the extreme secrecy of
      their movements, we might show just as plainly that other hundreds of
      thousands are sent here at every Presidential election by European
      capitalists, European manufacturers, and European sovereigns, with a view
      to influence our elections. Bribery at elections being made a misdemeanor
      in nearly all the States, movements of this character have to be conducted
      with extreme secrecy; but that the thing has been done for the past forty
      years (ever since the inauguration of the protective system by Henry
      Clay), and is still being done, there is not a shadow of doubt; nor is
      there a doubt that this is another one of the reasons why the Democratic
      party is kept alive. A single Hartford convention killed the Federal
      party; a single set of pro-slavery resolutions, adopted by a National
      convention, killed the Whig party; and the part which the Democratic party
      took in the late rebellion would have killed it so effectually that no
      resurrection could have ever reached it, but for the support it has had,
      and still has, from European powers, through emigration and through the
      Catholic Church, and with the once avowed, and now no less steadily held,
      object of overthrowing our representative form of government, and of
      destroying the liberty of our press. Thus, my friend (the reader), your
      second query is answered beyond, as we think, all possibility of
      successful contradiction.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>O the casual
      reader, the relationship that this question bears to "Secrets of the Late
      Rebellion, now Revealed for the First Time," may seem very obscure, but to
      our mind, that sees the end from the beginning, the relationship seems
      very close, as our readers will also see, we think, before we close the
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick Henry, in one of his outbursts of eloquence, said he "knew of no
      way to judge of the future save by the past." Taking this as our guide,
      let us inquire somewhat into the history of former republics, and see if
      we cannot gather therefrom some probabilities as to the future of our own,
      and some light by which to guide our own footsteps meanwhile. Our plan and
      limited space will only permit us to take a bird's-eye view of four&mdash;Athens,
      Sparta, Thebes, and Rome&mdash;but even from these alone we may learn some
      useful lessons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The republic of Athens came into existence immediately after the voluntary
      death of King Codrus, about 1068 years before Christ. Codrus having been
      made to believe, through an oracle, that if he sacrificed his own life,
      his country would be victorious over the Heraclidæ, with whom they were
      then engaged in war, disguised himself as a peasant, and, purposely
      quarrelling with a soldier of the hostile army, procured the death he
      wished. His sons, Medon and Nileus, disputed the succession to the crown;
      and the Athenians, taking advantage of this dispute, determined to set
      aside the crown altogether, and thenceforth have a representative or
      republican form of government. Hence arose the Athenian Republic. Though
      they abolished the title of king, out of the high regard they had for
      Codrus, they appointed his son Medon chief magistrate for life, and even
      made the office hereditary, so that for three hundred and thirty-one years
      thereafter the chief magistrate continued in that family. They then
      abolished the perpetual archonship, and made the tenure of the office ten
      years. This term they reduced erelong to one year, and, instead of one
      archon or chief magistrate, appointed nine, with equal authority.
      Meanwhile their government became so purely democratic as to become
      utterly despotic, and the tyranny of the mob was found to be more
      oppressive than the restraints of a single ruler. Then followed the laws
      of Draco, which, because of their severity, were said to have been
      "written in blood." He made no distinction of offences, but punished all
      equally with death. He weakened the authority of the Areopagus, and
      instituted a new tribunal, in which judges were given almost unlimited
      power, and virtually made brutes. The severity of his laws defeated their
      own object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the condition of things when the great lawmaker, Solon, appeared
      on the stage, five hundred and ninety-four years before Christ. The laws
      which he framed and gave the Athenians were not, as he said himself, "the
      best possible, but the best which the Athenians were capable of
      receiving." To the rich he gave offices and dignities; to the poor he gave
      the right of suffrage, whereby in the framing of laws, the election of
      magistrates, the making of war or peace, the forming of treaties and
      alliances, and in all that regarded either religious or civil policy, they
      should have an equal voice with the rich, and, being much the greater in
      number, their class could overbalance the other three, though out of their
      class could no nomination be made to any office of honor or profit. A
      senate of four hundred members held an intermediate place between
      office-holders and the people, and served as a restraint upon both. The
      arbitrary power of the judges, as established by Draco, Solon restrained,
      and made the court of Areopagus the chief judicial tribunal, and gave it
      also a tutorial power over all the youth of the republic. Instead of
      having an egotistical, half-educated state school superintendent to do
      such duty (as sometimes found in this country), this court appointed
      masters and governors for the youth, and superintended their education.
      The Areopagus also inquired into the life and morals of all who held
      offices in the state, and such as could not stand the scrutiny were not
      only incapacitated for employ, but declared infamous. His laws also
      prohibited all imprisonment for debt, and contained many other provisions
      in which legislators have made no improvement during the nearly two
      thousand five hundred years that have passed since then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the good laws of Solon, then, as now, there were found men
      to take advantage of their provisions to gratify their own private hates.
      Thus, Solon's laws allowed popular action for most offences&mdash;regarding
      all offences as against the "peace and dignity of the state"&mdash;as we
      do now; but in many cases advantage was taken of this by bad men to make
      the most calumnious accusations against men whose character until then had
      stood even above suspicion. So advantage was frequently taken of the law
      of ostracism (which was only meant for good), whereby some of their very
      best men were banished from the state. Thus, when an ignorant citizen was
      about to cast his vote for the ostracism of Aristides, he was asked by
      Aristides himself, who chanced to be passing by at the moment, and who was
      unknown t&lt;\ him:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what harm, my friend, has Aristides done to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None in the world," replied he; "but I hate to hear everybody call him
      the 'Just.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thucydides also, from whom Athens had received the most eminent services,
      was in like manner banished by ostracism; as likewise were Miltiades,
      Cimon, Themistocles, Phocion, and many other of their most eminent men.
      What was meant, too, for religious freedom was made to subserve (by those
      who temporarily had the power) the purposes of religious bigotry, tyranny,
      and persecution, until even the renowned philosopher, Socrates, was made
      to drink the fatal hemlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the great majority of Athenians were entirely satisfied with their
      form of government; while the masses were equally jealous of their
      liberty, because liberty was equally necessary to each for the enjoyment
      of his favorite scheme of life; yet there were those inside of the
      republic, as well as outside, who did not like a republican form of
      government, and who were all the while watching for an opportunity to
      overthrow it Among these was Pisistratus, a man of large wealth, splendid
      talents, and of great popularity. He aspired to sovereign power, and by
      his artifices came so near in obtaining it, that Solon, disgusted at the
      want of patriotism among his countrymen, and unable to witness its
      degradation, bade adieu to Athens, and died in voluntary exile. He&mdash;even
      he, the great and good Solon&mdash;was made to feel what it was to be "a
      man without a country," and chose to die in exile rather than to remain in
      his native land, or even to look upon it again in a state of degradation..
      If the time should ever come (and God only knows how soon it may come!)
      when not only one but scores, yea, hundreds, of American Solons should be
      wandering throughout the world, without a home and without a country,
      because of the destruction of our representative form of government by
      European jealousy and Catholic bigotry, then, if never before, they and
      all others will fully understand something of the natural outgrowth of the
      Democratic party of this country, of which the late rebellion was the
      first act in the drama, and of which its secret workings only represented
      the machinations of a hundred Pisistratuses!
    </p>
    <p>
      But though Pisistratus thus usurped power, and for a while played the
      sovereign, he was unable to retain it long. Megacles and Lycurgus, the
      chiefs of the Alemæonidæ, gained at length so much strength as to attack
      and expel the usurper from Athens. By a stratagem he again secured power,
      and, on dying, bequeathed the crown to his sons, Hippias and Hipparchus,
      but erelong Hipparchus was killed, and Hippias dethroned, and once again
      the republic prevailed, and statues were erected to the honor of Harmodius
      and Aristogiton as the authors of their country's deliverance from
      tyranny.
    </p>
    <p>
      From thenceforth there was almost a constant warfare between the political
      parties or factions of the republic, while jealous eyes outside were
      consequently watching an opportunity for its destruction. Ambitious
      demagogues were constantly using the people as their tools, but scarcely
      would one obtain the chief magistracy until another would pull him down&mdash;if
      not by a vote of the people, then by faction or by assassination.
      Meanwhile Hippias, who had been dethroned, sought aid from the king of
      Persia to reinstate him, and thus brought a long and bloody war upon his
      own country. In this war were fought the renowned battles of Marathon,
      Salamis, Plateæ, and Mycale, and the Greeks came off victorious, but at a
      most fearful sacrifice of treasure and life. After this followed the
      disunion among the several Grecian states&mdash;the secession of some&mdash;the
      coldness and indifference of others; and though the brilliant
      administrations of Cimon and Pericles seemed to revive the republic for
      awhile, it was evident to all that the seeds of death were fast
      germinating and would bring forth fruit erelong. The Persian king, and the
      sovereigns of other surrounding countries, had long felt deep jealousy of
      the Athenian Republic, and, when an excuse came for attacking it, they
      were not backward in availing themselves of the opportunity. Fortunately
      for the Athenian Republic the attack made upon them by Persia had the
      effect to bring the whole power of the Spartan Republic to their aid,
      which, with such other aid as they received from minor states of Greece,
      enabled them to defeat the Persians in the end and maintain their own
      independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a worse fate awaited them&mdash;namely, a fight among themselves. The
      mutual jealousies that had long existed between Athens and Sparta broke
      out afresh, and soon terminated in an open war between the two republics,
      and most of the minor states of Greece took a part in the quarrel. The
      first declaration of hostilities, however, was compromised before they
      came to actual conflict; but it proved to be only a smouldering, and not
      an extinguishment, of the fire that had long burned in the breast of each&mdash;a
      fire that afterwards broke forth in what was known as the "Peloponnesian
      war," and lasted twenty-eight years. Our plan and space will not permit
      any details of this. A history of the first twenty-two years of the war
      was admirably written by Thucydides, and of the last six years by
      Xenophon, to whom we must refer the reader who would know its particulars.
      Suffice it to say here that during this long internecine war each achieved
      victories and each suffered defeats. At one time the Spartans so reduced
      Athens as to make an entire change in its constitution. The republic was
      abolished and thirty governors, or, as the Greek historians style them,
      "thirty tyrants" were substituted, whose power seems to have been
      absolute, unless in so far as each was restrained by the equally arbitrary
      will of his colleagues. So fearful and terrible was their rule, that
      Xenophon thinks "a greater number of Athenian citizens lost their lives by
      the sentence of these tyrants, in the short space of eight months, than
      had fallen in the whole twenty-eight years of the Peloponnesian war."
      Hundreds of the most eminent of the Athenian families left their country
      in despair, and what remained were for a time awed into silence, and dumb
      with consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And just here we may pause to say that precisely the same kind of rule,
      and the same kind of results, would have been witnessed in this country,
      had the rebellion, by the aid of the Democratic party, succeeded in
      capturing Washington and in establishing their rule over this country. It
      is one of the "Secrets of the Late Rebellion, now Revealed for the First
      Time" (and our information comes from one who was behind the scenes and
      knew all about it, and the first sixteen chapters of this volume entirely
      confirm this opinion), that behind President Davis and behind General Lee
      stood a body of desperate men, who, at one single sweep, would have wiped
      them off the chess-board and put others in their stead, had they shown the
      least considerate humanity in dealing with Northern men, in case the
      rebellion had succeeded. Not Abraham Lincoln alone would have fallen at
      the hands of the assassin or hangman, but thousands of others throughout
      the North would have suffered a like fate, until the rule of the "thirty
      tyrants" in Athens would have been considered but child's play in
      comparison with the rule of the more than three hundred tyrants of this
      republic. Then would have been witnessed here, as there, thousands of the
      most eminent of American families leaving their country in despair&mdash;wandering
      they knew not whither&mdash;without a home, and without a country! Abraham
      Lincoln's assassination was indeed done by a half crazed Southern rebel;
      but who can doubt, after reading the secrets revealed in the foregoing
      pages, that the frenzy that fired Booth's brain, and the nerve that
      enabled him to fire the deadly shot, came as directly from the Democratic
      party, as a party, as that the pistol itself was purchased by a Democratic
      partisan. All these facts go hand-in-hand, and there is no separating one
      from the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we have already occupied much more of time and space on the Athenian
      Republic than we had intended. We can only say, in conclusion, that, after
      the reign of the "thirty tyrants," its fortunes were up and down&mdash;oftener
      down than up&mdash;until the battle of Chæronea, which occurred in the
      year 338 before Christ, when the liberties of Greece were made to yield
      finally and forever to the stronger arm of the Macedonian. The Athenian
      Republic had existed after a fashion&mdash;and, indeed, much of the time
      it was orderly "after a fashion"&mdash;for seven hundred and thirty years;
      and when it fell, there was not so much as an empty shell left. Its
      internal dissensions, more than anything else, had eaten out its vitals;
      the jealousy of surrounding monarchies had been to it a constant source of
      danger, and several times a source of great disaster; while for fully
      one-half of the seven hun-dren and thirty years it was rather a government
      of tyranny than of liberty to those who lived under it.

      CHAPTER XXI. OF SPARTA AND ITS LESSONS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>PARTA was built by
      Lacedaemon as early as 1487 years before Christ; but it did not become a
      republic until Lycurgus remodelled its laws, eight hundred and eighty-four
      years before Christ. Though a representative form of government, and
      therefore a republic, yet it was so different from any other government
      that ever existed before or since, it may well be called unique, singular,
      sui generis. Its citizens, for instance, ate at public tables; the
      children were regarded as belonging to the state rather than to parents;
      its money was made of iron and of such weight that no one man could carry
      a hundred dollars. Thus, and in other ways, the accumulation of wealth was
      discouraged&mdash;while instruction in the art of war was made pastime&mdash;meat,
      drink, and sleep, as it were, to all its male inhabitants. The labor of
      its farms, of its shops, of its merchants even, was all done by slaves;
      while the administration of government, the learning how to fight, and
      fighting, seems to have been the principal, if not the only, employment of
      its free citizens. Though existing at the same time with the Athenian
      Republic, and within one hundred and eighty-four years as old, the two
      governments were in no sense a type of each other. The Athenian found in
      his taste for pleasure constant employment; the Spartan's taste was only
      for war. The arts of Athens met with the highest encouragement; at Sparta,
      scarcely none at all. At Athens the luxury of the rich constantly employed
      the industry of the poor; at Sparta, luxury was regarded as almost
      criminal, and he who indulged in it was regarded with contempt, if not
      with execration. The sciences were also cultivated by Athenians with the
      same ardor as the arts; while Spartans cared nothing for science, except
      so far as it contributed to the efficiency of warfare. As another, in
      contrasting the two republics, has very aptly put it, "Sparta was
      altogether a military establishment; every other art was prohibited,
      industry among individuals was unknown, and domestic economy unnecessary&mdash;for
      all was in common. The Lacedaemonians were active only when at war. In
      peace, their manner of life was languid, uniform, indolent, and insipid.
      Taught to consider war as the sole honorable or manly occupation, they
      contracted a fierce and ferocious turn of mind, which distinguished them
      from all the other states of Greece. Despising the arts themselves, they
      despised all who cultivated them. Their constitution was fitted to form a
      small, a brave, and an independent state; but had no tendency to produce a
      great, a polished, or a conquering people."
    </p>
    <p>
      Between our own and a republic so peculiarly constituted, we can hardly
      make comparisons; and yet we find, even in that, some features like in our
      own. Lysander was not only a great general, but, as Plutarch calls him, he
      was a fox as well. Richelieu, when told that his enemies called him a fox,
      said: "Fox!&mdash;Well, I like the nickname! What did Plutarch say of the
      Greek Lysander?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph. I forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richelieu. That where the lion's skin fell short, he eked it out with the
      fox's! A great statesman, Joseph, that same Lysander!
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin Van Buren, both before and after he became President of the United
      States, was called a fox, because of his great slyness and shrewdness in
      pulling the wires for the Democratic party. He denounced that party before
      he died, however, and allowed himself to be run against their regular
      candidate for the Presidency; and, were he alive to-day, and knew of the
      secrets which this volume discloses, no man in the United States would be
      more free in denouncing that party for the part it took in the rebellion,
      and for the part it is still taking in helping Europeans in their designs
      to overthrow this government and the freedom of the press, than Martin Van
      Buren.
    </p>
    <p>
      This republic, like that of Athens, had its ending with the battle of
      Chæronea, b.c. 338, after which the all-conquering Philip took possession
      of it and of all the states of Greece. The republic had existed after a
      fashion (for here, as at Athens, it was only "after a fashion" part of the
      time) through a period of five hundred and forty-six years; but finally
      died from the ambition of those within and the jealousy of those without.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thebes was the last of the Grecian republics, but for a time shone with as
      much brilliancy as either of the others. It had its origin from fortuitous
      circumstances rather than from the genius of any lawmaker; but it produced
      and nurtured legislators as wise as Solon or Lycurgus, and soldiers as
      brave and as brilliant as Pericles or Lysander. When Athens and Sparta
      were visibly tending to decline, Thebes suddenly rose to a degree of
      splendor which eclipsed all her sister and contemporary states.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before b. c. 382, at which time the citadel of Thebes was seized by
      the Spartans, the government of the Thebans was called republican, but it
      was rather so in name than in fact. The oligarchic party at Thebes,
      corresponding with the Democratic party of this country, were all the
      while aiming at the establishment of an oligarchy, while the patriotic
      supporters of liberty and independence were just as determined not only to
      maintain the republic, but to make it so in fact as well as in name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last-named party of Thebes corresponded precisely with the Republican
      party of this country. When the contention between these two parties was
      at fever heat, it happened that Phoebidas, a Lacedaemonian general, was
      sent with an army to punish the people of Olynthus, a Thracian city, for
      an alleged infraction of a treaty of peace formed not long before. While
      Phoebidas was on this expedition, Leontiades, the head of the oligarchic
      party at Thebes, prevailed on him to second the attempts of his party
      against the liberties of their country. The Spartan general yielded to the
      suggestion, and, while the unsuspecting Thebans were celebrating the
      festival of Ceres, Phoebidas marched his army into the city and took
      possession of their citadel. When the republicans of Thebes protested
      against this, the Spartans acknowledged it an act of treason in Leontiades
      to have thus betrayed his country, and they reprobated the conduct of
      Phoebidas in giving his aid to a measure which was a direct infraction of
      a national treaty; but being now masters of Thebes, they did not choose to
      abandon their acquisition.
    </p>
    <p>
      If through the influence and aid of Lord John Brewerton (the particulars
      of which are given in the fifth chapter of this volume) and others like
      him, the heads, the Leontiadeses, of the Democratic party of this country,
      could have betrayed our government into the hands of Great Britain, and
      thereby pleased every other kingly government of Europe, every Englishman
      would have acknowledged that somebody had played the traitor, and that it
      constituted not only a direct infraction of the treaty between their
      government and ours, but an infraction of the law of nations as well; yet,
      like the Spartans, they would have been unequal to the conflict between
      virtue and self-interest, and, like them, would have replied, Now that we
      have the country, we'll keep it!
    </p>
    <p>
      But though the "mills of the gods grind slowly, they grind exceeding
      fine," and erelong the republicans of Thebes, headed by the brave
      Pelopidas, and seconded by the no less brave Epaminondas, shook off the
      Spartan yoke&mdash;shook off the oligarchy&mdash;and reëstablished a
      republican form of government, and from thenceforth the Theban Republic
      went forward in a career of glory equal to anything that Athens or Sparta
      could ever boast. The battle of Leuctra, in which six thousand Thebans,
      commanded by Epaminondas, entirely defeated twenty-five thousand
      Lacedaemonians, leaving four thousand, with their chief, Cleombrotus, dead
      upon the field, was but the beginning of a series of actions all of which
      reflected upon Thebes the highest glory. We have not room to relate these
      in detail, but one incident in the life of Epaminondas&mdash;at its close&mdash;we
      cannot omit. The full particulars of the incident may be found in Xenophon
      and Diodorus, but its gist is about as follows: At the battle of Mantinea,
      Epaminondas, too rashly pursuing his success, had advanced beyond the line
      of his troops, when, the enemy rallying, he was exposed to a whole shower
      of darts, and fell, pierced with numberless wounds. "His faithful
      Thebans," says Professor Tytler, "found means to rescue his body while
      life yet remained, and to bring him to his tent. A javelin stuck fast in
      his breast, and his physician declared that on extracting it he would
      immediately expire. In this extremity, breathless and fainting, while his
      friends stood weeping around him, he first inquired what had become of his
      shield, and being told that it was safe, he beckoned to have it brought to
      him, and kissed it. He then asked which side had gained the victory, and
      being told it was the Thebans, 'Then,' said he, 'all is well.' While some
      of his friends were lamenting his untimely fall, and regretting that he
      had left no children to perpetuate his memory, 'Yes,' said he, 'I have
      left two fair daughters, Leuctra and Mantinea (the names of battle-fields)&mdash;'these
      will perpetuate my memory;' so saying, with his own hands he drew forth
      the javelin from his breast, and instantly expired."
    </p>
    <p>
      If the republic at that moment could have died with Epaminondas, it would
      have gone out in a blaze of glory; but, alas! alas! it yet contained
      traitors in its own bosom, and was yet to reap the fruits of treason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip, King of Macedon, determined to subvert the liberties of all the
      Grecian republics. To him, as to European sovereigns of to-day, a
      representative form of government was hateful, as would have been the
      liberty of the press, had there been a press in those days. It was one of
      his favorite maxims that "no fortification was impregnable into which a
      mule could make its way with a bag of money!" as it was a maxim with the
      first Napoleon that "every man has his price?" In pursuance of this
      policy, Philip had his bribed emissaries in Thebes, as he had at Athens
      and Sparta. In Athens he had in his pay no less a man than Æschines, the
      great orator, and Aris-todemus and Neoptolemus, the two great comedians&mdash;all
      of whom were men of the highest influence in the public assemblies.
    </p>
    <p>
      With such men at the capitals of the three largest republics&mdash;all
      constantly declaring themselves' to be the "stanchest of democrats"&mdash;it
      was only a question of time with Philip when he should have the republics
      within his grasp. Demosthenes thundered and lightened worse than the
      natural elements. His "Philippics" rolled over the heads and hearts of the
      people, and found responsive echoes in thousands of breasts; but the
      still, small voice of Philip's gold in the pockets of leading loud-mouthed
      so-called Democrats had more influence than all the thunders of a
      Demosthenes. Philip's far-reaching plan was first to introduce treachery
      in the heart of each republic, and then set them at variance with each
      other, that his alliance might be courted and an opportunity furnished for
      introducing Macedonian troops into Greece. He had not long to wait for the
      maturing of his plans. The Phocians, instead of paying a fine inflicted
      upon them by the Amphictyonic Council (corresponding to our Congress),
      seized the temple of Apollo at Delphos, with all its treasures. This set
      the republics at war with each other&mdash;some siding with the Council
      and some with the Phocians. At length the Thessalians implored Philip's
      assistance against their tyrant, Lycophron, whose government they felt to
      be intolerable. The tyrant sought aid of the Phocians to support him
      against his own subjects. They responded to Lycophron, and Philip, with an
      alacrity that knew no precedent, responded to the people. The result of
      all this was that Philip obtained a strong foothold in Greece, the very
      thing he had so long sought through his paid emissaries. This advantage
      Philip followed up with the keen scent and persistence of a bloodhound,
      and although Demosthenes still continued to thunder against him, Philip's
      gold in the pockets of sordid ignorance, under the guise of democratic
      patriots, overbalanced the warnings of eloquence, and thus matters went
      on, step by step, until the battle of Chæronea, when, at one fell swoop,
      not only the republic of Thebes, but all the other republics and states of
      Greece, fell into the hands of Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can you not see, my friend (the reader), in all this some striking points
      of resemblance between the rise, progress, and fall of the Theban
      Republic, and the rise, progress, and what threatened to be the fall of
      our own government in the late rebellion?
    </p>
    <p>
      According to European notions, we had a sort of republic, a sort of
      representative form of government, prior to 1776; but it was rather an
      oligarchy than a republic, and Washington, Adams, John Hancock, and
      others, determined to have a real republic or die in the attempt. Seven
      years of terrible struggle and fearful sacrifice brought their wishes to a
      successful issue. From 1783 until 1822 the course of this republic was one
      blaze of glory, equal to anything that Thebes could ever boast. Meanwhile
      the jealous eyes of many European Philips had been looking on, and finally
      a Congress at Vienna, in 1822, entered into a solemn treaty with each
      other (two of the articles of which we have heretofore quoted) that
      representative governments, and the liberty of the press, were
      "incompatible" (that is the word) with "monarchical principles," and
      therefore ought to be abolished. In pursuance of this resolve the Philips
      of Europe began to send their gold into this country, of which no less
      than $612,656 were sent from a single city of France (Lyons) in four
      years, as we have heretofore shown from their own published reports. True,
      this was but a drop in the bucket, but it shows that the drops came from
      thick-lipped vials, and consequently were very large drops. Among the
      contributions made about that time, it was announced, with a great
      flourish of trumpets and as greatly to his credit, that the Emperor of
      Austria had contributed twenty thousand francs to "The Society for the
      Propagation of the Faith." For the propagation of what? Of the faith? God
      save the mark! Had the item read, For the propagation of the Democratic
      party, and, through it, monarchical principles, it would, in our humble
      judgment, have been nearer the truth. Of course we do not know&mdash;no
      one ever can know&mdash;what proportion of the money contributed in Europe
      and sent to this country (nominally to propagate the faith of the Catholic
      Church) went into the hands of State and National Democratic Executive
      Committees; but this we do know, as well as we know any conclusion drawn
      from known facts by deduction, that the money so sent had for its ultimate
      object (no matter into whose hands it first fell) more the destruction of
      the representative form of this government, and the liberty of the press,
      than the propagation of any religious faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      And let us pause a moment just here to say, that the process of
      investigation and of reasoning by which we arrive at the above conclusion,
      and at other conclusions heretofore announced, is very near to certainty,
      nor is it at all mystical. As Professor Huxley very aptly says, when
      writing of the results of induction and deduction, "The vast results
      obtained by science are won by no mystical faculties, by no mental
      processes, other than those which are practised by every one of us in the
      humblest and meanest walks of life. A detective policeman discovers a
      burglar from the marks made by his shoe, by a mental process identical
      with that by which Cuvier restored the extinct animals of Montmartre from
      fragments of their bones. Nor does that process of induction and deduction
      by which a lady, finding a stain of a particular kind upon her dress,
      concludes that somebody has upset the inkstand thereon, differ in any way
      from that by which Adams and Leverrier discovered a new planet. The man of
      science, in fact, simply uses with scrupulous exactness the methods which
      we all habitually and at every moment use carelessly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Though our present treatise is on history rather than on science, we have
      used the facts which have fallen in our way from a somewhat extensive
      reading and study of history with as much "scrupulous exactness" as though
      we had been writing upon science, and we feel within our own breast that
      the conclusions reached are very near, if not a dead, certainty. We did
      not make the facts that we have used. They have been parts of current
      history from time to time, extending through a period of nearly three
      thousand years. We have simply put the facts in logical form&mdash;in the
      form of proposition and proof&mdash;and then drawn therefrom such
      inferences as seemed natural and inevitable. Politicians will say, we
      know, that our conclusions are the result of preconceived opinions; bigots
      in religion will say that our conclusions are founded upon prejudice; but
      neither the one nor the other will be true. Take the same facts, and we
      defy any logician or rhetorician in the world to reach different
      conclusions, if honest with his own conscience before God.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. THE CONCLUSION OF THE WHOLE MATTER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>AVING more than
      consumed the space allotted for this volume, we have neither room nor time
      left in which to write of the Roman Republic as its importance demands,
      and as indeed we should gladly have written. And yet we confess there is
      not, or ought not to be, any necessity for adding another word. If the
      lessons taught us from what we have learned of the three preceding
      republics have not opened our eyes to the dangerous tendencies of the
      Democratic party as a party; if we are not already convinced that the
      leaders of that party, and those who stand behind the scenes to prompt the
      leaders and furnish them with the "sinews of war," in the shape of
      European gold, have for their ultimate object the setting aside of our
      representative form of government and the destruction of the liberty of
      our press, then we would not be convinced though one arose from the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, then, need we add a word about the founding of the Roman Republic,
      five hundred and ten years before Christ; why tell of the law, then for
      the first time enacted by the Senate, that any citizen who had been
      condemned to death by a magistrate, or even to banishment, or corporal
      punishment, should have the right of an appeal to the people before the
      sentence went into effect; why tell of the wars in which the republic was
      thenceforth engaged, and how gloriously the people sustained the honor of
      the republic; why tell how the people were afterwards betrayed by their
      rulers, and made to suffer the most intolerable hardships until they
      obtained the privilege of electing tribunes; why tell of the struggles
      that these tribunes of the people had with rulers chosen by the
      aristocracy for many, many years in maintaining for the people the rights
      for which they had made immense sacrifice of life, and which they valued
      so highly; why tell&mdash;as it would take an entire volume to tell&mdash;how
      corruptions crept, from time to time, into the heart of the republic, how
      ambition took the place of patriotism, how the leaders in the provinces
      were watching with jealous eyes those at Rome and vice versa, how Caesar
      finally "passed the Rubicon," how he seized the government, how he
      attempted to put on a crown, and in the attempt lost both the crown and
      his life; and how, when great Caesar fell, fell the republic, with a crash
      that was heard to the uttermost ends of the earth? If we were to tell all
      this with the precision of a Montesquieu, or with as much display of
      learning as an Abbé de Vertot, there could only be gathered therefrom
      precisely the same lessons as we have already learned from the rise,
      progress, decline, and downfall of the three Grecian republics.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus, my friend (the reader), we are finally brought face to face to
      the last clause of your third question, as to What is to be the final end
      of this republic?
    </p>
    <p>
      The shortest answer would be, We don't know, and then stop right there;
      but this would not be satisfactory to you. The next shortest answer will
      be that our republic will, in all human probability, follow the fate of
      the Grecian and Roman republics, and that it is only a question of time
      when that shall be. We know that such a confession is humiliating to one's
      pride, and that we would all much rather believe, as it is usual for
      Fourth of July orators to say, that "this republic is to last forever!"
      but alas! alas! for human vanity, it is only too true that "history but
      repeats itself!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But, allowing this answer to be the correct one, it by no means lessens
      your and my responsibility; for whether that end comes in twenty years, or
      two hundred years, or two thousand years, depends altogether upon
      Americans themselves. There are good, and true, and intelligent men in
      every political party, as there are good, and true, and intelligent men in
      every religious organization. While we conscientiously believe that the
      tendency of the Democratic party to be just as we have repeatedly stated;
      and while we as conscientiously believe that the Roman Catholic Church, as
      a church, is being made use of by European sovereigns, just as we have
      repeatedly stated; yet we believe, indeed, we know, that both in that
      party and in that church are as good men, as true men, and as intelligent
      men as are to be found in any party or in any church on earth; and if
      these will but unite with the good, and true, and intelligent of other
      parties and of other churches, the representative form of this government,
      and consequently its liberties, and the liberty of its press, may be
      preserved yet for many scores of years, if not for many centuries. It is
      no mere figure of speech to say that "the price of liberty is eternal
      vigilance" Like panthers crouching and waiting for their prey, the enemies
      of this government are all the while on the watch. They have their paid
      emissaries not only at Washington, but at every State capital, just as
      Philip of Macedon had among the republics of Greece. A lack of vigilance
      upon the part of patriots may, at any one of our national elections, put
      the general government into their hands. This once in their hands, they
      will find a way, or make one, as we have heretofore said, to hold it for
      all time to come; for every crowned head of Europe would at once, openly
      or secretly, rally to their support. Then would come a weeping, and
      wailing, and gnashing of teeth, but, alas, it would be too late! Then
      would be found Americans in all parts of the world without a home and
      without a country, but their regrets, alas! would bring back neither.
      There are Greeks and Romans to-day, as there were Greeks and Romans two
      thousand and three thousand years ago; but it blurs the eye to see (as we
      have seen in their own lands), and it sickens the heart to think (as any
      intelligent man may think) of, the difference between a citizen of Greece
      and of Rome to-day and of the citizen who lived when they were republics!
      Pigmies and giants are the only two English words we have to express such
      difference; but to one who has seen and felt the difference, while
      travelling through their own lands, these words fail utterly to convey a
      true conception of the real difference which exists.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, my good friend (the reader), I must bid you farewell. We have
      travelled a long way together&mdash;longer, perhaps, than has occurred to
      you as we have steadily pursued our course. Starting in our own times, and
      with events in some of which we have ourselves taken part, we have slowly
      ascended the river of time until we reached a point (the beginning of the
      Athenian Republic) nearly three thousand years from where we started.
      Then, retracing our way, we slowly descended the river, stopping long
      enough to gather a few grains of wheat at one place, a few grains of rye
      at another, a few grains of corn at another, and so on, and on, until we
      have got back to where we started. In the beginning of our journey we
      peeped into some dark places&mdash;places into which the light of history
      never before had shone, but which, from this time forth, will be as well
      known as any other facts of the great rebellion.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that I have done for you, in all these journeyings, is, at near the
      close of our pilgrimage, to select out the different kinds of grain,
      arrange them in form of proposition and proof, just as any other logician
      or rhetorician might have done, and then point out to you that, if we
      would be profited by these grains (of information), picked up on the way,
      and treat them in a certain manner, they would yield wholesome bread and
      sustain life (the life of our republic) for many years to come; whereas,
      treated in another way, these same grains would only make the vilest of
      whiskey, which, used wrongfully, could only lead to misery and final death
      here and eternal death hereafter. In some things, my friend (the reader),
      your knowledge is far beyond mine; in others, mine may be greater than
      yours, because of chances of information which happened to come in my way
      instead of coming in yours. While glad to learn anything I can from you, I
      have only done my duty, for which I claim no credit&mdash;only done as I
      would wish to be done by&mdash;in communicating to you such facts, and the
      unmistakable inference from such facts, as were secrets with others until
      they came to me, and secrets with me until I now communicate them to you,
      and through you and the printed page to the rest of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, what is your and my duty in the premises? Is it to sit with
      folded hands and see our glorious republic drift on and on until it falls
      into the hands of the Democratic party, and then into the hands of
      European sovereigns, and then is blotted out in one eternal night? Or
      shall we not rather (as Gough so graphically pictures in one of his
      inimitable lectures) cry aloud to those whom we see carelessly sailing on
      the river of Time&mdash;the Niagara River,&mdash;only a little way above
      the rapids, and within plain hearing of the thundering of the
      all-devouring falls&mdash;"Young men, ahoy there; the rapids are below
      you!" And if they should at first respond with a "Ha! ha! we will laugh
      and quaff; all things delight us; what care we for the future?"&mdash;then
      to cry again, still louder than before, "Beware! Beware! The rapids are
      below you!" and if, after all this, they still go shrieking, howling,
      blaspheming over the falls of the river of Time, your skirts and mine will
      be free of their blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, to change the metaphor, my friend, let you and I and all of us who
      love a representative form of government, who love the freedom of the
      press, who love our own glorious republic&mdash;let us, whenever we see
      the "ship of state" floundering in the breakers and liable to be engulphed
      by the angry waves of passion, hate, and self-interest, imitate the
      example of our blessed Saviour, and cry aloud, "Peace; be still!" and
      though we may not, like Him, calm the waves by miraculous power, yet, if
      with our cry we put our shoulders firmly together, and pull at the same
      end of the rope, all of us who really love the republic&mdash;the honest
      Democrat with the honest Republican, the honest Catholic with the honest
      Protestant&mdash;we and our descendants may save the "ship of state" from
      sinking, at least for many years, if not for many centuries to come. And
      may God bless and prosper every such united effort for the saving of our
      glorious republic!
